She was discharged to home\nwith Keflex on [**2-24**] with a 7 to 10 day course of antibiotic\nscheduled.  She was brought in today by her daughter after\nbeing found down in her apartment. The daughter was out of\ntown for the last five days, returned today and found the\npatient down on the afternoon of admission.  She had seen the\npatient the night before and the two had had dinner and there\nwere no problems at that time.  There was no loss of\nconsciousness.  By the patient's report, there was no chest\npain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, no head trauma.\nBy the daughter's report, the patient had not been taking any\nof her medications for the last five days.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Hypertension\n2.  Hypercholesterolemia\n3.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial\ninfarction in [**2150-12-12**].  ETT with inferolateral\nreproduced perfusion defect, moderate mitral regurgitation,\nmild to moderate AS.  Ejection fraction greater than 55% on\n[**2150-12-12**].\n4.  Hypothyroidism on chronic replacement\n5.  Diverticulosis, last colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 404**] of '[**49**]\n6.  External hemorrhoids\n7.  Status post fall with a pubic ramus fracture\n8.

Her daughter is\nher healthcare proxy and the telephone number ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2651**].\nThere is no tobacco or alcohol history.\n\nPRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\n\nADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.3??????, blood pressure 113/68, pulse\n83.\nGENERAL:  Alert and oriented to person only in no acute\ndistress.\nHEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Dry mucous membranes,\nbilateral surgical pupils, no jugular venous distention.\nNECK:  Supple.\nPULMONARY:  Bibasilar rales, no wheezes.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper\nsternal border with 1/6 regurgitant murmur, holosystolic\nmurmur at the left lower sternal border radiating to the\napex.  The PMI is nondisplaced and is a normal size.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel\nsounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.\nEXTREMITIES:  Large 10 x 5 cm medial right malleolus ulcer\nwith scattered areas of necrosis and surrounding erythema.\nThere is no swelling.\n\nADMISSION LABS:  White count 10.9, hematocrit 31.5, platelets\n416.  SMA-7 143, 5.7, 104, 23, 43, 1.7 and 106.  Urinalysis\nshowed trace ketones, small bilirubin, nitrite negative, no\nleukocyte esterase, no red blood cells.\n\nIMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion,\nbut no cardiomegaly.  A head CT was negative and hip films\nwere also negative.\n\nIn the Emergency Department, the patient was initially\nnormotensive.  She was started on intravenous cefazolin and\ndeveloped hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the\n80s.  She was then started on low dose dopamine and admitted\nto the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.\nAdmission electrocardiogram shows ST depressions in 1, 2, F,\nV5 and V6.  T-wave inversions present diffusely.\n\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU\nwith a strong concern of evolving non Q-wave myocardial\ninfarction.  Indeed, the patient's peak CK was 335 with an MB\nof 28 and an MB index of 8.4.  The associated troponin was\n16.1.  After discussion with the family, the patient was\nconservatively managed and cardiac catheterization was not\npursued.\n\nWith volume resuscitation, the patient's hematocrit dropped\nto 26.3.  Iron studies revealed the following:  an iron of\n287, TIBC of 398, ferritin of 49 and transferrin of 306.  It\nwas felt that the patient had anemia of chronic disease on\nthe low hematocrit reflected hemodilution.  Her dose of\nNiferex was increased to [**Hospital1 **] and her hematocrit remained\nstable after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells.\n\nIn terms of the patient's elevated creatinine, this also\nresponded quickly to volume resuscitation.\n\nThe patient had recently been in house with a concern of a\nright lower extremity cellulitis versus pyoderma gangrenosum.\nThe patient was seen by dermatology and it was felt that the\nlesion was most consistent with partially treated ulcerated\ncellulitis.  The patient was initially started on cefazolin\nand clindamycin.  She developed diarrhea in the setting of\nclindamycin therapy.  Stool toxin assays did reveal the\npresence of the Clostridium difficile toxin A and the\npatient's clindamycin was discontinued and she was started on\nmetronidazole.  On the day of discharge, the patient was\nswitched over from intravenous cefazolin to oral cephalexin\nwith no difficulties.\n\nThe patient was evaluated by physical therapy and it was felt\nthat she was unsteady on her foot and would need 24 hour\nsupervision.\n\nAn echocardiogram was obtained which revealed a normal\nejection fraction, normal valves and no resting wall motion\nabnormalities.\n\nOn [**2153-3-12**], the patient was felt to be medically stable for\ndischarge.  Given the setting in which the patient was\ndiscovered and the physical therapy evaluation, it was felt\nthat she would benefit from a course of short term\nrehabilitation.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Discharged to short term\nrehabilitation.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.  Levoxyl 75 mcg po qd\n2.  Celexa 30 mg po qd\n3.  Anusol HC prn\n4.  Calcium carbonate 600 mg po bid\n5.  MVI 1 tablet po qd\n6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po qd\n7.  Lipitor 20 mg po qd\n8.

Right lower extremity cellulitis complicated by\nulceration\n\nDISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up in\n[**Hospital 2652**] Clinic at [**Hospital6 256**] in\none week's time.  The patient will follow up with her\ncardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at [**Hospital6 2018**] in two weeks' time.\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1013**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 1014**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 2653**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2153-3-12**]  13:46\nT:  [**2153-3-12**]  13:55\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 2654**]\n\"\n1429,79556,148982,2126-11-25,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2126-11-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-11-25**]\n\nDate of Birth:  [**2064-4-22**]             Sex:   F\n\nService: MEDICINE\n\nAllergies:\nDemerol / Codeine / Zocor / Crestor / Lescol / Fosamax /\nPercocet / Advair Diskus / Azulfidine / Celexa / Cymbalta /\nAugmentin / Pradaxa / Statins-Hmg-Coa Reductase Inhibitors /\nPhenergan / Penicillins\n\nAttending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]\nChief Complaint:\nhypoxia, persistent fever\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n- mechanical ventilation\n- bronchoscopy\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\n62 y/o F  with PMH of CAD s/p multiple PCIs (at least 9 DESs\nplaced in 8 separate PCIs since [**2118**]), paroxysmal AFib (on\nwarfarin), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of\npericarditis, severe RA (on prednisone 5, leflunomide,\nremicaide), GERD, pulmonary fibrosis (but FVC 76% of predicted\nin [**2121**] with DLCO 65% of predicted), and other issues, admitted\nto OSH on [**2126-11-12**].  Initially presented with flu-like symptoms\nand a subjective fever for about one week.  In the ED there, CXR\nshowed baseline interstitial pattern and possible right basilar\ninfiltrate.  She was noted to have  a'red hot' leg in the ED,\nbut no obvious joint effusion.  In the ED, she spiked a fever to\n102.8, persisting and never falling below 100.8 during her\nhospitalization.  WBC was 15.4 (no bands), ESR>120, CRP>18.\nCreatinine was 1.3 on admission, down to 0.9 with fluids.  Flu\nwas negative and blood, urine, C. diff cultures have been\nnegative to date.\n\nShe was given levofloxacin and vancomycin for pulmonary and skin\ncoverage; antibiotics were broadened to levofloxacin,\nceftazidime and vancomycin IV and PO.  Her SBP was in the 90s in\nthe ED, she was volume resuscitated and SBP improved.  TTE and\nOSH showed an EF of 50% without valvular lesions.  SpO2s have\nbeen in the low to mid 90s on 3L nasal cannulae.  She has also\nhad bad joint pain during her hospitalization.  CT chest showed\ndiffuse airspace disease, bilateral reticular changes of\nuncertain etiology, with the differential including infection,\nedema and fibrosis.\n\nShe was seen by rheumatology at the OSH, who felt she likely ha\na flare of her RA.  Steroids were increased from prednisone 5mg\nto 40mg.  Leflunomide toxicity was also raised as a possible\netiology, but level is pending and it is unclear when it will\ncome back.\n\nOn the night of [**11-14**], she experienced chest pain which resolved\nwith 3x nitroglycerin.  Troponin was elevated to 0.389, but with\nno EKG changes.  EKGs showed old left bundle branch block, but\nno STT wave changes.Interventricular conduction delay with a QRS\nof 93 was noted on subsequent EKGs.  Her lasix was held given\nrecent [**Last Name (un) **], but other cardiac medications were maintained.\nAnticoagulation with heparin or lovenox were thoguht to be\ncontraindicated  in the setting of anemia and therapeutic INR.\n\nOn arrival to the MICU, she appears ill, unable to complete full\nsentences and frequently short of breath.  She was able to\ncorroborate the above history.  She also reports possible tick\nexposure at the [**Last Name (un) 8548**] and in the garden of her home in the last\nfew weeks.

It is obscured by the lung abnormalities.  Mid and\nlower extensive lung opacities have markedly increased from\n[**11-12**].  Differential diagnosis is broad including diffuse\nmultifocal pneumonia, ARDS.  This could be superimposed to a\nmore chronic interstitial lung abnormality.  There are small\nbilateral pleural effusions.\n\n- TTE ([**2126-11-18**]): The left atrium is normal in size. There is\nmild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity\nsize. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior\nwall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %).\nThe estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no\naortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure\ncould not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w\nCAD (PDA distribution).

CXR showed diffuse\npuffy infiltrate b/l most consistent with ARDS. BAL was negative\nfor all infectious agents tested, and tick-borne panel was\nnegative. On bronchoscopy, blood was visualized, consistent with\npulmonary hemorrhage. She was intubated for airway protection,\nkept on ARDS settings, treated for HCAP with\nvancomycin/ceftazidine/levofloxacin for a total of 8 days, and\nwas diuresed with daily goal for -1-1.5L. She was transfused one\nunit of blood on [**11-17**] and two units of FFP on [**11-16**]. Her INR\nwas supratherapeutic on admission and warfarin was discontinued\nindefinitely. Workup for vasculitis including ANCA and anti-GBM\nwere negative. She improved on these interventions and was\nsuccessfully extubated. Her hematocrit remained stable for the\nrest of her hospitalization. Immediately following extubation it\nwas noted that she had some stridor, but appeared comfortable.\nUpon chin-lift maneuver, the stridor disappeared, suggesting a\nsupra-glottic cause. For this she was started on steroids. Her\nstridor resolved the following day and the steroids was\ndiscontinued. She was transferred to the inpatient floor where\nshe continued to do well. Her antibiotics was continued for a\ntotal of 8 days. She was continued on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. She\ncontinued on diuresis with lasix as needed for volume overload.\n\n\n# NSTEMI: On [**11-15**], she experienced chest pain and troponin\nleak. She did not have EKG changes consistent with ischemia. She\nwas maintained on aspirin and plavix. She underwent an echo,\nwhich was essentially unchanged from prior. Her troponins\ntrended down. Per cardiology recommendations, her aspirin was\ndecreased to 162mg daily and warfarin was held indefinitely.\n\n# Fever: Reportedly she had persistent fever while in OSH.\nHowever, she was afebrile during her stay at [**Hospital1 18**]. Differential\nincluded infectious source such as pneumonia or cellulitis vs.\ninflammatory secondary to rheumatoid arthritis. She was treated\nas above for pneumonia, and her fever curve was trended.\n\n# RLE Cellulitis: Improved with antibiotics and supportive care.\nShe was continued on vancomycin IV with plan to complete a 14\ndays course.\n\n# HSV infection: positive culture from oral swab. BAL negative\nfor HSV. She was started on acyclovir with plan to complete a 7\nday course. Ophthalmology consult was obtained with no sign of\nHSV keratitis.\n\n# Acute Kidney Injury: Resolved with IVF rehydration in OSH.\n\n# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Per discussion with\ncardiology, the decision was made to not restart her coumadin in\nthe setting of pulmonary hemrrohage. She was maintained on a\nbeta blocker and home diltiazem for rate control.\n\n# Anemia: Baseline Hct 27-31. Likely contributions from anemia\nof chronic disease and acute hemorrhage. She was transfused for\na goal Hct>21.\n\n#) Nutrition: poor nutrition due to painful oral ulcers and poor\ndenture. She was seen by speech and swallow who recommended\ncontinuing with regular diet with ensure supplements.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity\nsize and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF\n>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but\naortic stenosis is not present. Focal thickening at the tip of\nthe right coronary cusp might have increased slightly. No masses\nor vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small\nvegetation on the mitral valve (0.3cmx0.3cm) (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) at the\ncoaptation point. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild\n(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension.

Note is made of fluid\nextending outside the joint capsule, extending into the\nsubcutaneous fat, along the lateral and posterolateral aspect of\nthe knee (ser 6, im 18), unchanged from the prior study.\n\nCortical erosion of the articulating surfaces of the tibia as\nwell as\nenhancement of the tibial plateau is unchanged and likely due to\na combination of osteomyelitis, bone infarct, and secondary\nosteoarthritis. Bone marrow edema, enhancement, and erosion\nalong the posterior aspect of the patella is unchanged and are\nlikely related to osteomyelitis, infarct, osteoarthritis, and an\nabutting bone fragment. Bone marrow signal alteration and linear\nareas of enhancement in the femoral condyles is unchanged and\nmay be related to osteomyelitis and/or bone infarcts. Again seen\nis cortical irregularity and some areas of cortical disruption\nalong the femoral condyles.\n\nNo definite intraosseous or subcutaneous abscesses.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1) The overall appearance is unchanged compared with [**2190-5-12**]. No\nchange in\nbone marrow signal abnormalities in the femoral condyles, tibial\nplateau,\nproximal tibial metaphysis, and posterior patella, which likely\nreflects some combination of osteomyelitisand/or residual edema\nfrom treated osteomyelitis, bone infarcts, and secondary\nosteoarthritis.

Knee exam appears\nstable, MRI generally unchanged; [**Month/Year (2) **] did not feel it\nclinically warranted tapping. As renal function increased over\nMICU stay, ID advised increasing diflucan dose. Now on [**6-11**]\nmonths of PO fluconazole. To follow-up with [**Month/Year (2) 1957**] and ID as\noutpatient.\n.\nPossibe endocarditis:  Echo showed small new vegatation on\nanterior leaflet of mitral valve.  Not present on TEE from early\n[**Month (only) 205**]. Discussed with cardiology and reviewed imaging together;\nfollow-up in approximately 3 weeks with TTE to see if change in\nimaging (appointment as outpatient). No TEE necessary at this\npoint in time. Patient has never been bacteremic or fungemic. No\nnew murmur auscultated, no [**Doctor Last Name **] spots or other findings\nsuggestive of embolic disease seen by optho consult.\n.\nAcute renal failure with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and\nmetabolic acidosis: Hx NSAID abuse. Gap and non-gap acidosis on\nadmission, initially thought to be secondary to diarrhea,\nhowever low bicarbonate persisted beyond diarrhea cessation with\nassociated hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hypernatremia. This\nraised the question of RTA, but that is/was problem[**Name (NI) 115**] to\ninvoke in setting of ARF. Renal consulted. Pt treated with\nbicarb and then bicarb normalized. She continued to have some\nhyperchloremia, likely due to IVF which had previously been\ngiven. Hypokalemia corrected with repletion ?????? may also be [**2-1**]\nprolonged diflucan course or alcohol abuse. Renal advised\nstarting potassium citrate ?????? not on formulary, switched to\nBicitra; then d/c'd bicitra as renal function and acid/base\nstatus improved. Renal advised PO potassium and magnesium daily,\nand regular checks of electrolytes (chem 10) and renal function.\n.\nPossible UTI ?????? urine culture showed 10-100,000 klebsiella\nspecies.  Started Ciprofloxacin, 7 day course (last day [**8-25**]).\n.\nClostridium dificile colitis:  Pt started on treatment course\nfor C. difficile from OSH. Unclear how compliant pt has been\nwith treatment course, and c.diff +ve at OSH so decided to\nrestart a treatment course here. Initially on vanc/flagyl.\nC.diff culture negative x2 here in hospital. No diarrhea since\nadmission. Now just PO vancomycin (last day [**8-27**]).\n.\nHypoxemic respiratory failure: possibly combination of dCHF,\naspiration, reactive airway disease. CXR shows findings\nconsistent with volume overload; expiratory wheezes [**2-1**] COPD vs\ncardiogenic. Had 02 requirement, successfully weaned with\ninitial autodiuresis then minimal lasix. Pt irritated by\nalbuterol nebs, used atrovent nebs with good effect. Aspiration\nprecautions. Patient weaned down to room air, SpO2 100% at\ndischarge and without SOB.\n.\nHypertension: had been hypotensive in setting of prolonged\ndiarrhea, dCHF, decreased PO intake. Held antihypertensives, but\nthen pressures were persistently elevated. So treated with\nmetoprolol, clonidine, amlodipine, with dose adjustment as\nneeded. Lisinopril continued to be held due to ARF, during\nhospitalization. If continues to be hypertensive, suggest that\nnext med to be added/changed would be the addition of an ACE\ninhibitor, ie; lisinopril (was on 40mg daily, would start at\n10mg daily and titrate up, as tolerated by creatinine). Plan to\ntitrate down the clonidine, over 3 days, by halving dose each\nday (continuing tid though).\n.\nAlcohol Abuse with hx DTs/PRES:\nDiazepam per CIWA protocol. Got Zyprexa in ICU to provide some\nsedation with decreased benzo load and clonidine. SW consulted.\nNo s/s of withdrawal while on floor. Discussed alcohol cessation\nwith patient.\n.\nDiabetes mellitus, type II, poorly controlled: continued lantus\nand insulin SS, with adjustments to treat hyperglycemia\nthroughout hospital course. continue on sliding scale, and\nadjust as needed to treat blood sugars.\n.\nHypernatremia: corrected with free water drinking and D5W via\nIV. Etiology unclear; perhaps hyperaldosterone state - please\nfollow-up renin and aldosterone level tests, sent from [**Hospital1 18**] on\nthe patient - or renal tubular acidosis are questionable.\nEncourage free water drinking/hydration.\n.\nHypokalemia, hypomagnesemia: unclear etiology, perhaps due to\nalcohol or renal disease. Started daily PO potassium and daily\nPO magnesium, with regular electrolyte checks. Again, please\nfollow-up on renin and aldosterone level tests on this patient,\nsent out from [**Hospital1 18**] laboratory.\n.\nHypocalcemia - Pt had transient hypocalcemia raising question of\nhypoPTH or pseudohypoPTH, however PTH level wnl and hypocalcemia\nresolved with repletion.\n.\nOUTSTANDING LABS:  renin, aldosterone, drawn [**8-24**] at [**Hospital1 18**]\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAMLODIPINE - 5 mg daily\nFLUCONAZOLE - 400 mg daily\nFOLIC ACID - 1 mg daily\nHYDRALAZINE - 25 mg Tablet Q 6 hrs\nHYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE - 25 mg daily\nIBUPROFEN - 800 mg Tablet - Q 8 hours\nINSULIN GLARGINE - 100 unit/mL Solution - 18 units qAM to 45\nunits qPM\nLIDOCAINE - 5 % (700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, daily\nLISINOPRIL - 40 mg daily\nMETOPROLOL TARTRATE - 50 mg Tablet Q12\nOMEPRAZOLE 20mg Q12\nVANCOMYCIN - 250 mg Capsule - Q 8 - stop [**2190-8-12**]\nZOLPIDEM 10 mg QHS\nVITAMIN D-3 - 2,000 unit Tablet - 50,000 IU weekly\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

She responded to aggressive\ndiuresis but refused laboratories and had [**Last Name (un) **] compounded by\nsevere C.Diff colitis. She also continued to chronically\naspirate.\n\nMICU COURSE [**7-19**] to [**7-21**]\nPatient was transferred to the MICU from the CCU service [**7-19**]\nthrough [**7-21**] for altered mental status and hypotension. Patient\nhad not had labs for several days and was found to be in acute\non chronic renal failure to Cr of 3.7, which was likely from\nover agressive diuresis with torsemide. Cr improved with gentle\nIV hydration from 2.6 to 1.7 whil in the MICU. Mental status\nimproved with improved renal function. Cdiff was managed with\noral vancomycin 250 mg QID with Flagyl 500 mg IV Q8H, and\npatient was kept NPO. Surgery and ID remained involved during\nthis care. KUB revealed colonic ileus, but patient continued to\nhave [**2-14**] stools per day and abdominal exam was benign.\n\nBY PROBLEM.\n\n1. Diastolic Heart Failure, Severe and Acute on Chronic\n\n  On arrival to the CCU, patient was tachypneic and very short\nof breath. Her symptoms were thought to be secondary to acute on\nChronic diastolic heart failure (elevated BNP and evidence of\npulmonary edema on CXR).  ECG notable for atrial flutter,\nexacerbating her heart failure symptoms.  She was briefly placed\non BiPAP, but became very agitated and removed the bipap.  She\nwas diuresed with lasix drip and given morphine.  Patient was\nvolume overloaded on exam, with . She was initially diuresed\nwith a lasix drip and metolazone.  Her creatine increased after\ndiuresis and lasix drip was briedly held.  She was subsequently\nstarted on 100mg PO torsemide. This was complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] (see\nbelow). She was ultimately discharged on alternating doses of 30\nand 40mg of torsemide. We are tolerating a creatinine of [**2-13**],\naiming toward 1.5.\n\n2. [**Last Name (un) **]\n\n  Patient over diuresed in the setting of refusing lab draws.\nThis, in the setting of hypotension, prompted a brief MICU\ntransfer. It resolved with IVF. In the name of euvolemia, it was\nresolved to tolerate a creatinine of [**2-13**].\n\n3. Severe C. Diff Colitis\n\n  Patient had recently finished long vancomycin taper.  PO vanc\nwas started prophylactically while she was treated for her UTI\nusing cipro.  Cholestyramine was held given patient's complaints\nof constipation on admission. This became markedly worse. She\ncame under control with higher doses of PO vanc and IV flagyl.\nOn discharge she was kept on a taper of vanc po and later\nrifaximin.\n\n4. Aspiration\n   Comfort Eating\n   DNR/DNI\n\n  Patient is known chronic aspirator. Video swallow revealed\n[**Month/Day (2) **] aspiration. Speech and swallow reccommended NPO. Patient\nhas had PEG in past, family recognized that patient prefers to\neat for comfort and pleasure. Patient allowed to eat and drink\nand made DNR/DNI with no MICU transfers. At the time of\ndischarge, the family was considering a do-not-hospitalize\npolicy.\n\n5. Atrial flutter\n\n  Admission ECG notable for atrial flutter.  Amiodarone was\ndiscontinued.  She was continued on metoprolol 37.5mg tid and\nsubsequently switched to metoprolol succinate 100mg daily. Due\nto blood pressure limitations, her dose was titrated to safety.\nShe was discharged on Metoprolol 25 mg TID.  Patient not\nanticoagulated given significant history of GI bleed, though she\nwas kept on aspirin 325mg.\n\n6. CAD\n\n  Patient has history of 3 vessel disease s/p multivessel CABG\nand MVR in [**2122**]. She denied any symptoms of chest pain.  Her ECG\nwas without ischemic changes.  Her cardiac markers were\nelevated, in the setting of CHF and renal insufficiency.  She\nwas continued on aspirin, metoprolol and simvastatin.\n\n7. UTI\n\n Urine notable for ecoli sensitive to cipro.  Patient was\nfebrile in the ED, but defervesced upon arrival.  She was\ntreated with cipro for her UTI and started on vanc\nprophylactically given her significant history of c diff. This\nfailed. The patient has asymptomatic bacteriuria. She should\nnever be treated with Cipro. She can receive cranberry juice.\nConsider intravaginal estriol for treatment of atrophic\nvaginitis and therefore UTI ppx.\n\n8. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes:\n\n Patient was hypoglycemic on arrival to the ICU and responded\nwell to 1 amp D50 with appropriate response to blood sugar.  Her\ninsulin regimen was initially held and restarted at a lower dose\nof glargine 6U (previously on 10 U) once blood sugars stable.\n\n9. Hypothyroid: Patient continued on her synthroid.  TSH was\nchecked and was within normal limits.\n.\n#. HTN: Metoprolol\n.\n#. HLD: Continued home statin.\n\nSPECIAL NOTES\n1. Please check Na, K, HCO3, Cr and BUN every 3 days. This\ninformation is crucial to the management of her heart failure.\nIt is appropriate and encouraged to keep her Creatinine at 1-2\n(~1.5)\n2. Physical Therapy: Please work on strength and stamina. Keep\nOut of bed for meals.\n3.  Telemetry. Patient in atrial fibrillation. Tachycardia > 110\ncan be a sign of overdiuresis.\n4. Diuretics:\na. Weigh patient daily. If increase in > 3lb, must contact MD\nand increase diuretic\nb. Must tolerate creatinine between 1 and 2. Effective diuresis\ncauses mild renal failure. If creatinine > 2, then reduce\ntorsemide dose. If cr < 1.3, then increase torsemide dose.\nConsult with MD. Consider changing dose by 10 mg.\nc. Patient is resistent to oral lasix\n5. UTIs\na. Do not give patient antibiotics for UTI unless positive that\nit is causing symptoms. Cipro causes C.Diff\nb. Encourage cranberry juice consumption\nc. Consider Intravaginal estriol for atrophic vaginitis and\nprevention of bacteriuria\n6. Aspiration\nPatient chronically aspirates. Her family is aware of this.

The patient was admitted to the\nhospital under the Orthopedics Service and taken to the\nOperating Room on [**2176-9-26**], where the patient underwent\nuncomplicated L5-S1 decompression/fusion with right ICBG\nplacement for noted lumbar spondyloses.\n\nThe patient initially tolerated the procedure well without\ncomplication.  The patient was transferred to the Floor on\n[**2176-9-27**].  The patient was noted to exhibit increasing\nconfusion.  The patient's epidural catheter was discontinued\non postoperative day number one and the patient was started\non PCA pain control.\n\nOn [**2176-9-28**], postoperative day number two, the Orthopedics\nService notes the patient increasingly confused and now\nagitated.  Psychiatry is consulted.  Conclusions of\nPsychiatry consult are the following:  History and\npresentation of agitation, somnolence and disorientation\nconsistent with delirium, although patient has denied recent\nalcohol use, his past history would strongly suggest alcohol\nwithdrawal.  Psychiatry Service suggests alcohol withdrawal\nprophylaxis with Ativan, continuation with one-to-one sitter\nfor patient's safety.\n\nOn [**2176-9-29**], the patient was noted to be increasingly\nagitated, fever of 100.5 F., is noted; tachycardia to 110\nbeats per minute noted.  Orthopedics Service continuing with\nalcohol withdrawal prophylaxis, Ativan and normal saline drip\nfor decreased sodium and chloride in the likely setting of\nvolume depletion.\n\nOn [**2176-9-30**], Orthopedics Service is called to see patient\nfor increasing tachypnea, tachycardia and general agitation.\nA fever is noted at 101.3 F.; heart rate between 110s and\n120s.  EKG is notable for sinus tachycardia.  A portable\nchest x-ray is notable for poor inspiration.  Left lateral\nlung parenchymal margin not captured; patchy asymmetric\nvascular congestion, greatest in right middle lobe.  Right\nupper lobe and left lower lobe with hilar fullness.  Cannot\nrule out right middle lobe infiltrate with normal cardiac\nsilhouette.\n\nOn [**2176-9-30**], postoperative day number four, a Medical\nconsultation is obtained for the above symptomatology.\nRecommendations are to discontinue intravenous fluid in\nlikely setting of volume overload, position the patient\nupright, cycle CK and troponin to rule out myocardial\ninfarction in the setting of congestive heart failure.  Begin\nLevaquin 500 intravenously q. day as treatment for likely\npneumonic process.  Recommending CT angiogram to rule out\npulmonary embolism in the setting of immobility and recent\nsurgery.\n\nOn [**2176-9-30**], the Medical Service accepted the patient from\nthe Orthopedic Service for further treatment for complicating\nissues.\n\nOn [**2176-9-30**], while in the service of the Medical Team, the\npatient underwent CT angio of the chest to rule out pulmonary\nembolism which was noted as negative.  Mental status change\ncontinued in the setting of delirium; alcohol withdrawal was\nsuspected.  Haldol for p.r.n. agitation was continued while\nQTC interval was monitored.  Antibiotic regimen was changed\nfrom Levaquin to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for possible\naspiration pneumonia coverage.\n\nOn [**2176-10-1**], postoperative day number five, medical\ncross-coverage was called to see the patient for increasing\nrespiratory rate from 34 to 50 per minute and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental\nstatus, now notable to be unresponsive to sternal rub or\npainful stimuli.  On physical examination, it was noted the\npatient's pupils were fixed and dilated with only minimal to\nsluggish responsiveness.\n\nChest x-ray was noted for increasing right middle lobe\ninfiltrate and right middle lobe opacity.  On [**2176-10-1**], in\nthe morning, at around 09:15, an Anesthesia Code was called.\n\nAnesthesia Team responded to the bed of Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] and noted\nunresponsiveness and agonal breathing.  The patient was\nintubated successfully with the use of Atonomate 10 mg,\nsuccinyl choline 100 mg.  A MAC 3 blade was used without\ncomplications and an 8.0 endotracheal tube was used.  Good\nbreath sounds were noted bilaterally and a right femoral vein\nline was inserted at that time.\n\nOn [**2176-10-1**], postoperative day number five, the patient was\ntransferred to the Service of the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit-[**Location (un) **] Team.  Initial thoughts on accepting the patient\nMr. [**Known lastname 14782**] by the Medical Intensive Care Unit Team:  From a\nrespiratory standpoint the patient demonstrated a large\npneumonic process on chest x-ray with [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status\nnecessitating intubation.  The plan was for pressure support,\nventilation, and treatment with Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin,\nFlagyl and aggressive pulmonary toilet.\n\nFrom a neurological standpoint, differential included alcohol\nwithdrawal versus metabolic versus infectious, although the\npatient had denied alcohol use since [**2176-2-8**].  From a\nneurological standpoint, head CT scan the prior evening on\n[**2176-9-30**], was noted as negative for acute process.\n\nOn [**2176-10-1**], the patient was procedurized with a right\nradial arterial line and a left subclavian Cordis\nPA-catheter, both without complications.  Initial readings of\nPA-pressure are 25/10, wedge was 5.  The patient was noted to\nhave a fever of 108.0??????F.  Aggressive use of ice packs and\ncooling blankets were utilized.  Surgery was consulted which,\non [**2176-10-1**], placed a right chest tube, #36 French, without\ncomplication with infusion of one liter of cold sterile\nwater.\n\nOn [**2176-10-2**], the patient was noted to be hyperthermic to a\ntemperature maximum of 108.0 F., despite cooling blankets, OT\nlavage and placement of chest tube.  Dantrolene was given,\n100 mg intravenously times one for fear of malignant\nhyperthermia secondary to succinyl choline versus Haldol use.\nArterial blood gas notable for severe acidosis.  Started on a\nbicarbonate drip.  The patient was noted to be persistently\nhypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and\ncontinuing use of Neo-Synephrine, Levophed and vasopressin\ndrips.\n\nAcute renal failure was noted to be worsening on [**2176-10-2**].\nThe Renal Service was consulted which noted a rise in CK to\ninitially 13,500.  Renal dysfunction thought secondary to\nhypoperfusion/rhabdomyolysis.  Urine output was noted to be\nminimal.  As such, Renal Service proceeded with CVVH\ntreatments via left femoral Quinton placement without\ncomplications.\n\nOn [**2176-10-3**], it was noted that the patient's CPK levels\nwere 49,305, consistent with a picture of rhabdomyolysis.\nBUN and creatinine indicating worsening renal function.\nLactate worsening to 11.3.  The patient was started on CVA\nwith citrate anti-coagulation on [**2176-10-3**].  Temperature\nmaximum noted on [**2176-10-3**], was 102.0??????F.\n\nOn [**2176-10-3**], postoperative day number seven, in the Medical\nIntensive Care Unit, the patient's white count was noted to\nbe 33.1 despite aggressive antibiotic therapy including\nLevofloxacin, Flagyl, Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for question\nof central nervous system process.\n\nOn [**2176-10-4**], at 01:15 a.m., Medical Intensive Care Unit\ncross cover intern was called to see patient for lack of\nrespirations.  On examination, the patient did not respond to\nverbal or noxious stimuli.  Pupils were fixed and dilated.\nThere were no peripheral pulses.  Auscultation of the chest\nfor two minutes revealed no breath sounds and no heart\nsounds.  The patient was pronounced dead at 12:55 a.m. on\n[**2176-10-4**].\n\n\n                          DR.[**First Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 734**] 12-944\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14783**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2177-5-9**]  14:54\nT:  [**2177-5-9**]  17:33\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 14784**]\n\"\n4823,20643,181462,2103-08-23,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2103-8-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-8-23**]\n\nDate of Birth:  [**2039-3-10**]             Sex:   M\n\nService: MEDICINE\n\nAllergies:\nLevofloxacin\n\nAttending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]\nChief Complaint:\nCC: shortness of breath\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\nnone\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\n64 yo male with Hx of CAD s/p NSTEMI, severe COPD with multiple\nintubations on chronic steroids who was recently discharged on\n[**2103-8-13**] after a flare now being admitted for hypercarbic\nrespiratory failure and hypotension. Pt was recently\nhospitalized for similar presentation on [**2103-8-4**] for which he\nwas intubated for 3 days and treated with an 8 day course of\nCeftazadime for pseudomonas that grew from his sputum and\nVancomycin for suspected sepsis for 3 days. He also breifly\nrequired Norepinephrine for hypotension although all blood\ncultures and Urine cultures remained negative. He now presents\nfrom with home after waking up acutely short of breath. He\nreports feeling well after discharge but was having difficulty\nlast night sleeping and decided to take Ambien 5mg which has\nworked well for him in the past. He awoke 4 hours later with\nshortness of breath. He attempted using his albuterol nebulizer\nwith minimal response and decided to call EMS. He denied any\ncough, sputum production, fever, chills or increasing SOB\nleading up to this episode. He denied any chest pain, chest\ntightness or palpitations.\n.\nIn the ED he was started on bipap with ABG of 7.35/58/265\nalthough no initial ABG obtained. He was initially hypertensive\nand tachycardix with BP of 200/100 and HR 140 but became\nhypotensive after starting BIPAP mask. He was started on\nCeftazadime and vancomycin due to hx of Pseudomonas in sputum\nand MRSA PNA in the past. He was also given IV solumedrol for\nCOPD exacerbation. His SBP was mildly improved after 1L IVF so\nsepsis protocol was not initiated.\n.\nOn transfer from [**Name (NI) 153**] pt reports that he is breathing much, much\nbetter than on admission, feels that the majority of his\nsymptoms were exacerbated by the heat and humidity.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was admitted to the\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypercarbic respiratory distress, although the ABG\nobtained in the ED suggested that the patient had good response\nto noninvasive ventilation.  There was no sign of pneumonia on\nCXR, and no evidence of increased sputum production to suggest\nbronchitis or bronchiectasis.  Pt was placed on Prednisone 60mg\nwith plans for a slow taper.  It was felt the the acute nature\nof this episode's onset was concerning for CHF in the setting of\nischemia.  Even though he has no CAD on cath in [**4-10**], he does\nhave a hx of NSTEMI representing possible troponin leak from\ndiastolic dysfunction and subendocardial ischemia.  The initial\nECG on admission suggested rt heart strain but this is not\nunexpected in the setting of the patient's known pulmonary\ndisease. Cardiac enzymes were obtained x3 and were negative.\nThe patient was observed overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where good O2\nsats were observed on 4L by NC, along with neb treatments and\nprednisone.  A TTE was obtained that showed no evidence of new\nCHF.  The patient was transferred to the general medical floor,\nwhere he remained stable and by self-report was near or at his\nbaseline.  The patient did note exercise intolerance [**2-7**] air\nhunger, but stated that this was not proportionally different\nfrom his USOH PTA.  The patient received a total of 3 days of\nPrednisone 60mg, and was then decreased to 40mg on the day of\ndischarge.  The patient was given instructions for a very slow\ntaper that would bring him to no less than 20mg per day of\nprednisone by the time Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] saw the patient later in\nthe month.  PCP prophylaxis was considered by the attending\ngiven the length of the prednisone taper, but was decided\nagainst.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] recommended BiPAP overnight, and this\nwas started and titrated by respiratory care to settings of\n[**12-11**].  The patient tolerated this overnight without significant\nproblems.  The patient had been given a BiPAP machine roughly 6\nmonths ago from his home health agency, but he had not been\nusing it due to what he calls 'incorrect settings'.  Eventually\nthey took it back from him.  In order for him to re-qualify for\nreimbursement for BiPAP, Medicare requires documentation of an\nABG with a PCO2 greater than 55 (which this patient has many of)\nand also documentation of the patient desaturating to < 88% on\n2L or less of O2 by nasal cannula for 5 or more minutes.  The\nhome health company stated that this must be in the form of a\ncomputer printout or graph.  No oximeter in the inpatient side\nof [**Hospital1 18**] is capable of producing this printout.  Hence, the\npatient will be discharged without BiPAP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] and\nthe patient will work toward getting a study that will qualify\nhim for home BiPAP as an outpatient.\n*\n2. Hypotension: The patient had episode of hypotension in the ED\nin the context of non-invasive ventilation.  The hypotension in\naddition to the patient's elevated WBC count on admission raised\nconcern for sepsis, but the patient's low lactate as well as the\nrapid BP response to cessation of CPAP and starting of IV fluids\nallayed this concern.  The patient was initially started on\nCeftazidime and Vancomycin amid this picture, but these\nmedications were quickly discontinued as the initial clinical\npicture quickly improved.  His outpatient Lisinopril dose was\ninitially held in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but was restarted on the medical\nfloor prior to discharge, with no further episodes of\nhypotension.\n*\n4. Thyroid function: a TSH was checked in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], which was\nvery low.  A follow-up free T4 was also checked, and was found\nto be in the normal range.  It is difficult to interpret these\nfindings given the patient's acute COPD exacerbation and the\nstresses of an ICU stay.  Hence, the patient should have his TSH\nre-checked as an outpatient for further management.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.Aspirin 325 mg qd\n2.Atorvastatin Calcium 10 mg qd\n3.Calcium Carbonate 500 mg qd\n4.Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit qd\n5.Senna 8.8 mg/5 mL [**Hospital1 **]\n6.Sertraline 50 mg qd\n7.Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Neb q4hours\n8.Ipratropium Bromide Nebq4hours\n9.Multivitamin  qd\n10.Lisinopril 5 mg qd\n11.Prednisone 30mg qd on taper(down from 40mg on [**7-25**])\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

There is no acute intracranial\nhemorrhage,\nedema, mass effect, or infarct. The ventricles and sulci are\nprominent,\nconsistent with age-related atrophy. Supratentorial and\nperiventricular white\nmatter hypodensities reflect sequelae of chronic small vessel\nischemic\ndisease. There is bilateral calcification of the cavernous\ncarotid arteries.\n\nThere is mild mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal\nsinuses. The\nmastoid air cells are clear. There are no fractures. The orbits\nare\nunremarkable.\n\nIMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.\n\nCXR: [**3-28**]\n\nFINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2167-8-31**], there is continued\nenlargement\nof the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion\nor pleural\neffusion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.\n\nEEG [**3-29**]:\n\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured two pushbutton activations\nwhich\nwere described above. Routine sampling showed a mildly slow and\ndisorganized background consisting of mixed theta frequencies.\nThere\nwere no definite electrographic seizures seen on this recording;\n\nhowever, retrospectively, one of the pushbuttons showed some\nassociated\nsubtle right central rhythmic activity.\n\nEEG [**3-30**]:\n\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.\nRoutine\nsampling showed a mildly slow and disorganized background\nconsisting\nmostly of mixed theta frequencies. There were no areas of\nprominent\nfocal slowing and there were no epileptiform features seen.\n\nEEG [**3-31**]:\n\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured two pushbutton activations\nfor\ntwitching with no electrographic correlate. The background\nactivity\nshowed focal slowing in the right central and left temporal\nareas\nsuggestive of subcortical dysfunction in these areas. There were\nno\nclear epileptiform features\n\nEEG [**4-1**]:\n\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.\nThere\nwere a few generalized sharp waves, but these had more of a\ntriphasic\nappearance than a spike and slow wave morphology. The background\nwas\nmildly slow throughout, and there was modest frontal slowing, as\nwell.\n\nEEG [**4-2**]:\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.\nRoutine\nsampling and automated detection programs showed no clear\nepileptiform\ndischarges or electrographic seizures. The routine sampling\nshowed mild\nslowing of background frequencies throughout. There were no\nprominent\nfocal findings.\n\nCXR [**3-30**]:\n\nA Dobbhoff tube is coiled within the esophagus. The cardiac\nsilhouette is\nenlarged, unchanged from prior. There is no evidence of\npulmonary or\ninterstitial edema. The mediastinal silhouette, hilar contours\nand pleural\nsurfaces are normal. There is a small left pleural effusion and\nassociated\natelectasis. The remaining lungs are well expanded and clear.\n\nRepeat:\n\nFINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the\nDobbhoff\ntube tip now lies within the upper stomach, just distal to the\nesophagogastric junction. Little change in the appearance of the\nheart and lungs.\n\nCXR [**4-3**]:\n\nFINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-1**], there are lower\nlung volumes,\nwhich most likely accounts for the increased prominence of the\ntransverse\ndiameter of the heart. Basilar atelectatic changes are seen, but\nno evidence\nof acute focal pneumonia.\n\nThe Dobbhoff tube has been removed.\n\nDischarge Labs\n\n140 | 103 | 10\n---------------< 95\n3.3 |  29 | 1.1\n\nCa: 8.8 Mg: 1.8 PO4: 2.5\n\n       14.5\n13.9 >-------< 190\n       42.5\n\nPT: 21.4 PTT: 30.5 INR: 2.0\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n78 yo man with PMH of focal epilepsy, status epilepticus, Afib\non coumadin, CAD, HTN, HL, OSA admitted to the neuro ICU for\nfocal motor seizure with generalization.  At OSH/[**Hospital1 **] ED he\nreceived 7mg IV Ativan, 2gm Dilantin, 1 gm Keppra, 100mg\nOxcarbazepine, 130mg PHB, his focal motor seizure abated.\n\nNEURO:\n\nAt time of admission he still intermittently had left foot\nclonus, a few seconds at a time.  He was lethargic and\ninattentive.  Focal seizure exacerbation and generalization were\nattributed to 1. wean of zonegran by his wife and 2. UTI.\nRemaining infectious w/up was negative (CXR).\n\nHe received 1g of Keppra IV load in ICU folled by 1g [**Hospital1 **] for 1\nday.  Given persistent somnolence and episodes of apnea (30-45\nseconds) with bradycardia, and relatively rare L foot myoclonus,\nkeppra was decreased to 500mg [**Hospital1 **].  On this regimen MS improved,\nhe became more alert and oriented to [**Hospital1 18**] and year, however\nremained sedated. He was continued on oxcarbazepine 300mg [**Hospital1 **],\nincrease in which in the past has caused increasing fatigue and\nsomnolence.  The Keppra was later tapered off, and the\noxcarbazepine was increased to 600mg [**Hospital1 **].  The occasional focal\nleft foot myoclonus was not found to have an EEG correlate.\n\nCV. Initially volume overloaded, however, as PO intake decreased\nand maintenance dose of diuretic was continued, he reached\neuvolemia.  He is currently on Coumadin for his Afib, and given\nhis current diarrhea, his INR should be followed every 2-3 days\nuntil his diarrhea has resolved.\n\nPULM.  Multiple, frequent episodes of apnea while asleep and\nsedated, at times reaching 40-45 seconds in duration with\nbradycardia to 40s without desaturation.  Previously diagnosed\nwith OSA however unable to tolerate CPAP due to discomfort.\nPatient was maintained on BiPAP while at night and improved.  It\nwas felt that significant contribution to fatigue and somnolence\nwere contributed to by hypercarbia\n\nID.  UTI, treated with CFTX IV x 10 days. UCx was initially\ncontaminated, however did have hx of frequent UTIs.  On [**4-4**] he\nwas noted to have rising WBC count, and diarrhea.  Repeat U/A\nand CXR were negative, however given the diarrhea, stool was\nsent for c diff and he was started on PO vancomycin, to be\ncontinued through [**4-17**].  Based on discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]\nmay benefit from standing Macrobid in the future for UTI\nprevention, but will hold off on this plan for now given the\ncurrent c diff infection.\n\nFEN: He was evaluated by speech and swallow, and approved for\nregular solids, nectar thick liquids and crushed pills.  He is\nable to take thin liquids between meals.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLATANOPROST [XALATAN] - 0.005 % Drops - 1 gtt ou at bedtime\nMETOPROLOL TARTRATE - 100mg 1 5tab once a day\nSIMVASTATIN -  40 mg Tablet once a day\nWARFARIN -  5 mg Tablet - once a day\nOxcarbazepine 300mg [**Hospital1 **]\nAllopurinol 150mg once a day\nRanitidine 150mg [**Hospital1 **]\nAmlodipine 10mg daily\nChlorthalidone 25mg [**1-28**] tab every other day\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

No IV contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal\nreformats\nwere performed.\n\nFINDINGS: There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions. There is a\n5-mm left\nlung base nodule (2, 15) which is stable since [**2104**]. Within the\nlimitations\nof a non-contrast exam, the liver, gallbladder, right adrenal\ngland is\nunremarkable. The patient is status post left nephrectomy and\nleft\nadrenalectomy. The right kidney is atrophic. The pancreas is\nunremarkable.\nJust inferior to the pancreas within the root of the mesentery\nextending from\nthe inferior portion of the duodenum is extensive fat stranding\nand edema\nwithin the mesentery. This is nonspecific (2, 48). Small bowel\nloops are\nnormal in caliber and without focal wall thickening. There is no\nevidence of\nfree air. Small amount of free fluid is identified within the\nperihepatic\nspace (2, 18) and along the right paracolic gutter (2, 70).\nIncidental note\nis made of a distal esophageal duplication cyst (2, 21) which\nmeasures\napproximately 1.2 x 1.4 cm. Small bowel loops are normal in\ncaliber and\nwithout focal wall thickening. There is no evidence of\npneumatosis or free\nair.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS: Patient is status post transplanted kidney in\nthe right\nlower quadrant. A stent is identified within the renal artery.\nThe appendix\nis normal. The rectum, sigmoid colon, prostate is unremarkable.\nScattered\ncalcifications in the prostate gland are noted. A clip within\nthe bladder is\nunchanged (2, 81). There is no pelvic or inguinal\nlymphadenopathy.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions\nidentified.\nIncreased diffuse sclerosis of the osseous structures are likely\nrelated to\nrenal osteodystrophy.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Mesenteric edema extending from the root of the mesentry just\ninferior to\nthe pancreas adjacent to the duodenum, nonspecific in etiology.\nDifferential\ndiagnosis includes edema secondary to third spacing or vascular\ncompromise\n(SMA/SMV thrombosis?), or possibly bowel pathology although not\nabnormalities\nare noted in the bowel.

Top normal/borderline\ndilated LV cavity size. Normal regional LV systolic function.\nOverall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E/e' >15, suggesting\nPCWP>18mmHg. Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade II (moderate)\nLV diastolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT [**Year (4 digits) **].\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal\nascending aorta diameter.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No\nvalvular AS. The increased transaortic velocity is related to\nhigh cardiac output. No AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.\nModerate mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral\nvalve chordae. [**Male First Name (un) **] of the mitral chordae (normal variant). No\nresting LVOT [**Male First Name (un) **]. Calcified tips of papillary muscles.\nTrivial MR.

The left ventricular cavity size\nis borderline dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is\nnormal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal\n(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left\nventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler\nand tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II\n(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber\nsize and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets\n(3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.\nThe increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high\ncardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral\nvalve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral\nregurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity\nof mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]\nThere is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is\nno pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal\nglobal and regional biventricular systolic function.

Ultrasound-guided puncture of the right common femoral\n    artery.\n2. Catheterization of the right external iliac artery and\n    the transplanted renal artery.\n3. Pelvic angiogram and arteriogram of the transplant renal\n    artery.\n4. Balloon angioplasty of transplant renal artery stent.\n\nASSISTANT:  [**Name6 (MD) 547**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21891**], MD.\n\nTOTAL FLUORO TIME:  21.10 minutes.\n\nTOTAL CONTRAST USED:  10 ml of Visipaque.\n\nINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  This is a 61-year-old male with a\nhistory of end-stage renal disease, who is status post renal\ntransplant.  He has a history of acute renal failure and\nrenal artery stenosis of the transplanted renal artery.  She\nhad previously undergone stenting of the transplant renal\nartery, followed by in-stent angioplasty.  He presents again\nwith acute renal failure and suspected renal artery stenosis.\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained,\nthe patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed\nin supine on the angiography table.  After induction of\nanesthesia, both groins were shaved, prepped and draped in\nthe usual sterile fashion.  Using ultrasound the right common\nfemoral artery was identified.  It was patent.  Real-time\nvisualization needle puncture into the right common femoral\nartery was achieved with the ultrasound.  Hard copies of the\nimages were stored in the patient's chart for documentation\npurposes.  Using a micro sheath the right common femoral\nartery was accessed.  This was followed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire in\nthe abdominal aorta and a #5 French right tip sheath.  A\npelvic angiogram and transplant renal arteriogram were\nperformed.  This showed a patent transplant renal artery.\nGiven that the patient has repeated history of transplant\nrenal artery stenosis, we elected to intervene.\n\nUsing a Glidewire and an Omni flush catheter, we selected the\nrenal artery.  The catheter was then exchanged for a slip\ncath and a spider coil wire was then placed across the stent.\nUsing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21892**] 6 x 20 mm balloon, we performed an in-stent\nangioplasty.  No discrete stenoses was noted.  As there was\nno lesion, we elected to terminate the procedure at this\npoint.  All catheters and wires were withdrawn and the right\ncommon femoral arteriotomy was closed with a Perclose device.\n\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present throughout the entire case.\n\nANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:\n1. The right common iliac artery was widely patent, without\n    stenosis.\n2. The transplant renal artery was widely patent, without\n    stenosis.  The stent was crossed with a combination of\n    Omniflush catheter and Glidewire.  A 6 x 20 mm [**Location (un) 21892**]\n    balloon was used to angioplasty within the stent,\n    however no stenosis was noted.\n\n                        [**Name6 (MD) 547**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21891**], MD\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21893**]\nMEDQUIST36\nD:  [**2107-8-23**] 10:10:24\nT:  [**2107-8-23**] 22:30:59\nJob#:  [**Job Number 21894**]\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a 61 yo male with PMH for GERD/Barretts, HTN, TIIDM,\nESRD, and s/p kidney transplant, who came to the ED complaining\nof CP. In the ED he had EKG done and cardiac enzymes started.\nHis EKG showed no difference to prior EKGs and only Troponin T\nwas mildly elevated at 0.05. He was admitted to the floor for\nobservation and to rule out MI.\n\n#Chest pain: Cardiac problems are less likely because his\ncardiac enzymes were negative and his second EKG showed no\nchanges. He underwent stress testing, which was notable for\nmarked reduction in ability to exercise due to SOB but he had\nnormal cardiac perfusion and an echo demonstrating LVEF of 60%.\nIn summary his cardiac workup showed it to be non-contributory\nto this process. and second EKG ruled out MI and NSTEMI. His CP\nsymptoms and history of GERD and Baretts makes relfux the likley\ncause of his pain, which brought him to the ED.\n\n#Renal disease:Patient was noted to have elevated creatinine\nfrom baseline elevation (2.5-3.5). Also has history of ESRD in\nhis cadaveric transplant kidney. His FENA on admission was <1%\nwhich is suggestive of prerenal azotemia. He did not report\nbeing very dry and had this high creatinine in the setting of\nhigh BPs so he was considered also for renal artery stenosis (he\nis s/p stenting in transplant kidney renal artery). The team was\nalso worried about chronic kidney rejection and/or glomerular\nnephropathy from diabetes and longstanding HTN. Labs showed\nproetinuria of 30, but his baseline is up near 300. Renal\nservice followed his admission closely and was advising on BP\nmeds, fluids, and imaging of renal artery. On imaging he had a\nrenal artery US which showed increased resitance throughout the\ntransplant but no color flow changes in the renal artery. He\ncontinued to produce adequate urine despite his Lasix being\nheld. Also, a vascular surgery consult was ordered to assess for\nre-stenosis. He was taken to the OR for renal artery angiongram\nand possible intervention on 3 different occasions. On the first\ntwo no intervention could be taken as he was unable to lay flat\non the operating table. He was started on lasix and his\northopnea improved. On [**8-23**] he was taken to the OR for the third\ntime and was intubated for the procedure. Angiogram revealed\npatency of the renal artery, despite this the vessel was\nangioplastied. He developed mild respiratory failure after\nextubation, had to be put on NIPPV and was transfered to the\nMICU. In the MICU he was continued on diuretics and was\nsuccessfully weaned off NIPPV. He was transfered to the floor on\n[**8-25**] where he was continued on diuretics and his RF improved.\n\n#Orthopnea/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/OSA: Patient reported\nmultiple epsiodes of SOB, once while lying flat. Patient reports\na history of SOB with exertion from childhood (he has asthma\nhistory but no attacks as adult). Of note is he has significant\ncentral obesity that seems to be contributing to this orthopnea.\nHe also commented on abdominal distension and so CT scan was\nordered to assess for ascites, which would also be a mechanism\nfor pressure on the diaphragm. It showed mesenteric edema but no\nascitic fluid. His lungs have remained clear on physical exam.\nHe had an ABG whihc showed chronic respiratory acidosis. He also\nhad liver panel done to assess for hepatitis reasons for\npossible ascites, which showed adequate liver function. His\northopnea was thought to be due to a combination of dCHF, ARF\nand OSA. Once patient was diuresed his orthopnea improved. He\ndeveloped mild hypercarbic respiratory failure after extubation\nduring renal artery angiogram, had to be put on NIPPV and was\ntransfered to the MICU. In the MICU he was continued on\ndiuretics and was successfully weaned off non-invasive\nventilation. He was transfered to the floor on [**8-25**] where he was\ncontinued on diuretics and had no more respiratory problems off\nO2. The option of nightly use of NIPPV was discussed with the\npatient for treatment of OSA but he refused.\n\n#HTN: His HTN was very hard to control while in the hospital,\nhis medications had to be adjusted on several occasions because\nof SBP up to 200s. While in the MICU he was treated with a\nlabetalol drip that effectively decreased his BP. On transfer he\nwas transitioned to PO labetalol. His HTN was under better\ncontrol on the new regimen.\n\n#TIIDM: His blood sugars fluctuated each day throughout his\nstay. He was started on his home dose of NPH but this did not\nmanage his sugars well and so we switched to 20units AM and 10\nunits PM and a sliding scale. It is unclear why his home doses\nwere not effectively managing his sugars. He reported that he\neats differently at home, which could be partially contributing.\nHe had no more issues with hyper or hypoglycemia after his NPH\nadjustment.\n\n#CHF: His last echo showed compensated diastolic heart failure\nand the echo during this hospitalization showed LVEF of 60%\ndemonstrating adequate compensation. In light of these results\nand phsyical exam his CHF was thought to not be contributing to\nhis chest pain. He did have a slight troponin leak on admission\nbut this was thought to be due to RF.\n\n#Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism: Patient was found to have a\npersistently high Ca and a high PTH at 355. This was thought to\nbe due to tertiary hyperparathyroidism caused by his CRF. He was\nstarted on cinacalcet to treat this condition.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMinoxidil 10mg 1TAB 2xday\nPrednisone 5mg 1TAB daily\nClonidine  0.1mg 1TAB 2x daily\nCalcitriol 0.25mcg 1capdaily\nFurosemide 3TAB 2xday\nMycophenolate 500mg 1TAB 2xday\nLisinopril 10mg 1TAB QHS\nLabetalol 200mg 3TAB 2xday\nASA 81 mg\nHumalin NPH 20 units AM and 15 in PM\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

No spontaneous echo contrast or\nthrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial\nappendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial\nappendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right\nshunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.\n\nLeft ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.\nThere is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction with akinetic/aneurysmal basal inferior and basal\ninferoseptal walls. The mid and apical inferior, inferoseptal\nwalls are severe. Overall left ventricular systolic function is\nmoderately depressed (LVEF= 35% %).\n\nThe right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free\nwall hypokinesis.\n\nThere are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There is a\nridge of calcium/tissue in the ST junction, with a small mobile\natheroma. This point seems to be cause of increased transaortic\nvelocity of 1.7 m/sec, The velocity at the aortic valve seems\nnormal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic\naorta.\n\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.\n\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to\nsevere (3+) mitral central regurgitation is seen. There is no\nprolapse or flail mitral leaflets. The vena contract measures\nupto 6mm.\n\nThere is no pericardial effusion.\n\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]\n[**Known lastname 25457**] before surgical incision.\n\nPOST-BYPASS:\nPatient is on milrinone 0.25 mcg/kg/min and levophed 0.1\nmcg/kg/min.\nMild global RV systolic function.\nThere is a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position with\ngradients consistent with the prosthesis and usual washing jets.\nMild TR.\nThe thoracic aorta is intact.\nOverall LVEF 35%.\n  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance\nwith HCFA regulations.\n\nElectronically signed by [**Name6 (MD) 3892**] [**Name8 (MD) 3893**], MD, Interpreting\nphysician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2128-4-22**] 14:31\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room on [**2128-4-22**] where\nthe patient underwent Mitral Valve Replacement and CABG x 3 with\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well\nand post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable\ncondition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Transplant\nmedicine followed for her history of pancreatic and renal\ntransplants.  Labs were monitored closely.\nPOD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and\nbreathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact\nand hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and\nvasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient\nwas gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient\nremained in ICU for additional renal monitoring.  Coumadin was\nstarted for mechanical valve.  The patient was transferred to\nthe telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and\npacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The\npatient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for\nassistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge\non POD 6, the patient was ambulating, yet deconditioned, the\nwound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.\nThe patient was discharged to Apple Rehab in [**Location (un) 25461**],\n[**State 2748**] in good condition with appropriate follow up\ninstructions.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nCARVEDILOL PHOSPHATE [COREG CR] -  (Prescribed by Other\nProvider;\nDose adjustment - no new Rx) - 40 mg Cap, ER Multiphase 24 hr -\n1\nCap(s) by mouth daily (did not tolerate 60 mg) - No Substitution\nDARBEPOETIN ALFA IN POLYSORBAT [ARANESP (POLYSORBATE)] -\n(Prescribed by Other Provider) - 60 mcg/mL Solution - 60mcg/ML\nSQ\nonce weekly takes if HCT less than 35\nERGOCALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D2) [DRISDOL] -  (Prescribed by Other\nProvider: [**Name Initial (NameIs) 25458**]) - 50,000 unit Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth\nmonthly\nFUROSEMIDE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 20 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s) by mouth three times a day as needed for prn HAS NOT\nNEEDED RECENTLY\nHYDRALAZINE - 50 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth three times a\nday\nPREDNISONE - 5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily\nV42.0/V42.83 s/p kidney/pancreas transplant\nRANITIDINE HCL - 150 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a\nday\nROSUVASTATIN [CRESTOR] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider:\n[**Name Initial (NameIs) 25458**];\nDose adjustment - no new Rx) - 10 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by\nmouth daily\nSIROLIMUS [RAPAMUNE] - 1 mg Tablet - 2 Tablet(s) by mouth once a\nday\nSULFAMETHOXAZOLE-TRIMETHOPRIM - 400 mg-80 mg Tablet - 1\nTablet(s)\nby mouth Q MWF\nTACROLIMUS [PROGRAF] - 0.5 mg Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth\ntwice a day\n\nMedications - OTC\nASPIRIN -  (OTC) - 81 mg Tablet, Chewable - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth\ndaily\nCALCIUM-VITAMIN D3-VITAMIN K [VIACTIV] -  (OTC) - 500 mg-100\nunit-[**Unit Number **] mcg Tablet, Chewable - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day\nMULTI-VITAMIN HI-PO -  (OTC) - Dosage uncertain\nSENNOSIDES [SENOKOT] -  (OTC) - 8.6 mg Tablet - 2 Tablet(s) by\nmouth Daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n2. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n3. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4\nhours) as needed for temperature >38.0.\n4. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable\nPO DAILY (Daily).\n5. tacrolimus 0.5 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q12H (every\n12 hours).\n6. sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 400-80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1)\nTablet PO QMWF ().\n7. sirolimus 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n8. rosuvastatin 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n9. prednisone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n10. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)\nPO DAILY (Daily).\n11. sevelamer carbonate 800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID\nW/MEALS (3 TIMES A DAY WITH MEALS).\n12. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H\n(every 6 hours) as needed for constipation .\n13. warfarin 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily):\nMD to dose daily for goal INR 2.5-3.5 for mechanical mitral\nvalve.\n14. tramadol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4\nhours) as needed for pain .\n15. carvedilol 12.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n16. hydralazine 25 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO Q6H (every\n6 hours).\n17. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday).\n18. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal\nHS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.\n19. insulin glargine 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: Ten (10) units\nSubcutaneous once a day: 10 units Glargine with dinner.\n20. insulin lispro 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1)\nSubcutaneous four times a day: Humalog Sliding Scale per\nattached.\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\napple rehab\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n1.

Per notes, she had\nsymptoms worsening for the past day of shortness of breath and\nwas satting 89% on 6L NRB, with SBP of 180.  She was intubated,\nstarted on a nitro gtt, and was not diuresed prior to transfer.\nHer husband states that her shortness of breath starts suddenly\nand she told him he needed to call 911.

She has\nhad a couple of recent admissions into [**Hospital6 204**]\nwith shortness of breath and volume overload. She was just\ndischarged yesterday from [**Hospital3 **] after 2 other recent\nadmission for respiratory distress; she had been intubated,\ndiuresed and then extubated.  She stated that she still felt\nshort of breath and does not feel back to normal. She is\nconcerned about this worsening in her overall condition.

is status post right pelvis renal\ntransplant, which measures 12.6 cm. There is no evidence of\nhydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collections. The resistive\nindices of the main renal artery, upper, mid and lower pole\nintrarenal arteries range between 0.68 and 0.83, so borderline\nto slightly increased, which may reflect a parenchymal\nabnormality. The main renal artery waveforms in the renal pelvis\nitself show slowed upstrokes although they generally appear\nfairly brisk among interlobar arteries. The renal vein is\npatent. The urinary bladder is normal.\nIMPRESSION: Delayed upstrokes measured among some renal artery\nbranches\nsuggesting there may be renal artery stenosis upstream\n.\nECHO ([**12-27**]):\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Color-flow imaging of the\ninteratrial septum raises the suspicion of a small atrial septal\ndefect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this\nstudy. The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There\nis mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\nventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is regional\nhypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior left ventricular\nwalls. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest\nor with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic\nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is\nnot present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is\nseen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be\ndetermined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Suspicion of possible small atrial septal defect.\nMild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hypokinesis of\nbasal and mid inferior segments. Mildly dilated aortic arch.\nMild mitral regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery\nsystolic pressure.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-6-11**],\nthe basal and mid inferior segments of the left ventricle are\nnow hypokinetic; the previous images were suboptimal and\nregional wall motion was not assessed. Mild dilitation of the\naortic arch is now seen; not previously assessed. There is the\nsuggestion of a possible small atrial septal defect on the\ncurrent study; the interatrial septum was previously intact by\n2D color Doppler and saline contrast with maneuvers. The\npulmonary artery systolic pressure was not able to be determined\non the current study, but was previously moderate in severity.\n.\nCXR ([**12-28**]):\nFINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient\nin upright\nposition. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the\nnext preceding portable chest examination of [**2156-12-27**].\nHeart size is unchanged.  Previously described moderate\npulmonary congestive pattern with some upper zone\nre-distribution has normalized. Presently no evidence of\npulmonary interstitial alveolar edema and the lateral as well as\nposterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.\nNo pneumothorax in the apical area. No acute infiltrates.\nLateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  A previously\ndescribed old calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe area is\nunchanged.\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates.\n.\nCT Chest ([**12-30**]):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of interstitial pulmonary disease.\n2. Right middle lobe bronchial obstruction with atelectasis.\nBronchoscopy is recommended for further evaluation. Prominent\nright hilar lymph node measuring 7 mm in short axis diameter.\n3. Multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally as described above.\nFollow up chest CT is recommended in 6 months.\n4. Mildly prominent main pulmonary artery could suggest mild\npulmonary artery hypertension.\n.\nCardiac cath ([**1-6**]):\nCOMMENTS:\n1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system\ndemonstrates three vessel disease. The circumflex contains a 90%\nlesion in the mid-vessel. The right coronary artery contains a\n90% lesion in a small postero lateral branch. The left anterior\ndescending contains a 60% long lesion in the mid vessel.\n2. Hemodynamics demonstrate normal biventricular filling\npressures with a high cardiac output calculated using an assumed\noxygen consumption.\n3. Successful PCI to the LCx lesion with 2.5x15mm Promus DES.\n4. Manual sheath removal from right CFA.\n5. No complications.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.\n2. Successful PCI to the LCx lesion with Promus DES.\n3. Patient is to remain on Aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel\nfor at least 1 year, uninterrupted.\n4. No complications.\n.\nLE ultrasound ([**1-7**]):\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Patient hypoxic with pulmonary edema to\nassess for DVT. All of the deep veins in the right and left\nlower extremity show normal and full compressibility from the\ngroin to below the popliteal bifurcation. Color flow and pulse\nDoppler waveform analysis is normal throughout.\nCONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.\n.\nCXR ([**1-13**]):\nFINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, accompanied by\npulmonary vascular congestion. Interstitial edema has improved\nin the interval. Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated,\nwith improvement on the left. Bilateral small pleural effusions\nare also evident as well as multiple\ncalcified granulomas in the left lung.\n.\nCXR ([**1-17**]):\nFINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung\nvolumes have\nincreased. The right internal jugular vein introduction sheath\nhas been\nremoved. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has completely\nresolved. On the left, however, the pre-existing pleural\neffusion persists and has\nminimally increased in extent. There are subsequent areas of\nretrocardiac and basal atelectasis. Borderline size of the\ncardiac silhouette. Two calcified lung nodules in the left apex.\n\n.\nECHO ([**1-24**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal\ndefect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right\natrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Mild symmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left\nventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the\nbasal 2/3rds of the inferior wall. The remaining segments\ncontract normally (LVEF = 55-60 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular\nsystolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of\nvalvular regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index is high\n(>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation\nvelocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic\nhypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial\neffusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hyperrrophy with\nnormal cavitry size and regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD\n(PDA distribution). Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely\ndue to papillary muscle dysfunction. Pulmonary artery\nhypertension.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-12-27**],\npulmonary artery hypertension is now quantified. Left\nventricular wall motion and severity of mitral regurgitation are\nsimilar.\n.\nCXR [**2157-1-23**]\n\nET tube has been removed. Mild pulmonary edema has decreased.\nSevere left\nlower lobe consolidation is probably atelectasis, but following\nremoval of\nleft pleural tube, there could be a component of\nsmall-to-moderate left\npleural effusion that has developed. There is no pneumothorax.\nSevere\ncardiomegaly is longstanding. Right internal jugular line ends\nin the right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 5 cm to move\nit into the low SVC.\n\n[**1-27**] CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with\npatient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed\nin direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated\n[**2157-1-26**]. A right-sided PICC line is again identified.\nIt is now seen to terminate overlying the right-sided\nmediastinal structures at the level of the carina. Thus, it has\nbeen withdrawn by approximately 4 cm in comparison with the\npreceding examination and is now in good position in the mid\nportion of the SVC provided good venous flow has been\nestablished. No pneumothorax or any other placement-related\ncomplications identified. Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular\ncongestive pattern with some pleural densities in left base as\nbefore.\n.\n[**2-2**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-28**], there is continued\nenlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Pulmonary vascularity is\nmildly engorged but less prominent than on the previous study.\nOpacification at the bases with obscuration of the\nhemidiaphragms is consistent with bilateral layering effusions,\nmore prominent on the left, with underlying compressive\natelectasis. Central catheter tip again extends to the upper to\nmid portion of the SVC.\n.\nLABS AT DISCHARGE:\n[**2157-2-2**] 06:32AM BLOOD WBC-4.3 RBC-3.18* Hgb-9.4* Hct-28.5*\nMCV-90 MCH-29.6 MCHC-33.1 RDW-15.8* Plt Ct-233\n[**2157-1-28**] 05:38AM BLOOD PT-11.2 PTT-31.0 INR(PT)-1.0\n[**2157-2-2**] 06:32AM BLOOD Glucose-121* UreaN-58* Creat-2.1* Na-142\nK-5.0 Cl-100 HCO3-33* AnGap-14\n[**2157-2-1**] 06:12AM BLOOD ALT-33 AST-29 AlkPhos-88 TotBili-0.6\n[**2157-2-2**] 06:32AM BLOOD Calcium-9.5 Phos-5.3* Mg-1.9\n[**2157-2-2**] 06:32AM BLOOD tacroFK-7.3\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nSUMMARY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 27045**] is a 55 y/o woman with hx ESRD from T1DM\ns/p renal transplant in [**2154**], CAD s/p multiple MIs and DES to\ncircumflex artery ([**12/2156**]), ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF =\n55-60 %) who had a very long hospital course notable for\nrecurrent respiratory distress, which was multifactorial\n.\n# Respiratory distress:  She had multiple episodes of flash\npulmonary edema in the setting of acute on chronic diastolic and\nsystolic heart failure.   This required multiple intubations and\ntransfers to the ICU. The precipitants for these events included\nvolume overload, transfusions of blood products, hypertensive\nemergency, and coronary disease.  It was also felt that\nrapamycin toxicity may have been playing a role, so she was\nchanged to tacrolimus.  It was also felt that nitrates may have\nbeen causing VQ mismatch and worsening her hypoxia, so nitrates\nshould be avoided in the future. A Bronchoscopy on [**2157-1-5**] did\nnot reveal any pathology.  Her hypertension was aggressively\ntreated.  She was aggressively diuresed.  She was treated with\nalbuterol, inhaled steroids, bronchodilators, anti-cholinergics,\nand a glucocorticoid taper.  She was ultimately discharged to\nrehab with need for aggressive pulmonary rehabilitation.  Her\npersistent hypoxia that had been present for much of her\nadmission, despite appearing euvolemic, improved prior to\ndischarge, after rapamycin was changed to tacrolimus.  Rapamycin\ncan cause an asthmatic type lung disease, and the patient did\nhave evidence of wheezing and bronchiectasis on CT scan.\n.\n# Subglottic stenosis: The patient was a difficult intubation,\nsecondary to subglottic stenosis.\n.\n# Pleural effusion: It was felt this effusion was most likely\nrelated to heart failure.  Due to the risks of the procedure,\nthoracentesis was deferred.  She has follow-up with pulmonary,\nand the need for thoracentesis can be re-addressed at that time.\n Anti-coagulation for atrial fibrillation was deferred given the\npotential need for a procedure.\n.\n# CAD:  She has had multiple myocardial infarctions.  Ms [**Known lastname 27045**]\nhad a cardiac cath on [**2157-1-5**] showing diffuse disease.  She had\na DES placed in the left circumflex.  It was hypothesized that\nintermittent occlusion of this vessel (which supplies the mitral\nvalve) contributed to flash pulmonary edema by causing mitral\nregurgitation.  Her hypertension was treated aggressively, she\nwas maintained on atorvastatin, and she was instructed to take\naspirin 81mg and plavix daily.\n.\n# Renal disease:  The patient has a h/o renal transplant in [**2154**]\nfor ESRD secondary to HTN and T1DM.  She was maintained on\nazathioprine with dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**] (sulfa allergy).\nShe was transitioned to tacrolimus from rapamycin after it was\nsuspected that rapamycin toxicity was worsening her lung\nfunction.  Her creatinine fluctuated widely this admission in\nthe setting of ongoing diuresis, medications (ACE-I / [**Last Name (un) **]), and\ncontrast.  Angiography did not show renal artery stenosis. She\nhad an acute rise in creatinine with lisinopril treatment.\n.\n# Anemia:  An extensive work-up was largely unrevealing.  She\ndid have persistent epistaxis while intubated in the ICU, as\nwell as persistent hemoptysis after a traumatic intubation.  She\nwas conservatively transfused, given that she was very sensitive\nto fluid.  Additional lasix was absolutely necessary to prevent\nflash pulmonary edema with blood products. Darbopoetin should be\nconsidered as outpatient.\n.\n# Fevers: Ms [**Known lastname 27045**] developed fevers while in the hospital.\nShe had urine cultures positive for Pseudomonas, which was a\nlikely source.  However, she also had a pleural effusion, and\nshe was treated empirically for pneumonia with meropenem and\nvancomycin.  She was afebrile for many days off antibiotics\nprior to discharge.\n.\n# Atrial fibrillation: 2 episodes (once in MICU, once on floor)\nwith RVR which responded to 10mg IV metoprolol and 30mg IV\ndiltiazem.  It was felt this was secondary to cardiomyopathy and\npulmonary disease. She was initiated on warfarin (CHADS of 5).\nShe became supratherapeutic, and after administration of FFP\n(for planned thoracentesis) she had an episode of flash\npulmonary edema.  Re-initiation of warfarin was deferred to her\nprimary outpatient providers given her anemia and sensitivity to\nblood transfusions (volume overload) and potential need for\nthoracentesis at a pulmonary follow-up appointment.\n.\n# Type 1 DM:  On insulin pump.  Had multiple changes to her\nregimen in setting of intubation, treatment with\nglucocorticoids.  Managed by [**Last Name (un) **] in-house.\n.\n# Iatrogenic complications:  The patient had multiple\ncomplications from this hospitalization, including a fingerstick\nof 9 while on insulin gtt in the ICU; multiple intubations\nin-house, with mis-communication about her subglottic stenosis;\ninadvertant placement of a venous catheter into the sub-clavian\nartery requiring removal in the OR; multiple hand-offs of her\ncare between services, with associated poor communication\nbetween primary teams and multiple consultanting services; and\nshe was discharged from the hospital with a PICC line that was\nbeing used only for lab draws without communication of this to\nthe rehab center until after discharge.  The patient was\ninformed of these complications, and while frustrated, she was\noverall grateful regarding her care, and was excited about\ndischarge and was planning to follow-up at her multiple [**Hospital1 18**]\nappointments.\n.\n======\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES BY SYSTEM:\n-Cardiology: Severe 3 vessel CAD, s/p DES to L circumflex. On\nASA 81, Plavix, Atorvastatin.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\nwith CHADs score of 5.  Not on warfarin at the time of discharge\ndue to potential need for thoracentesis at a follow-up pulmonary\nappointment. To follow-up with Cardiology.\n.\n-Pulmonary: Multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema. Possible\nrapamycin toxicity.  Persistent hypoxia.  Pleural effusions.  On\nmultiple inhaled therapies.

You\nhad an extended stay in the hospital that included several\nepisodes of shortness of breath, high blood pressure, and kidney\ndamage.  Your shortness of breath was determined to be from\nheart failure, volume overload, and pulmonary hypertension (high\npressure in the blood vessels that supply your heart).  You were\ntreated with diuresis (water pills).  Cardiac catheterization (a\nprocedure to visualize the arteries that supply your heart with\nblood) was performed and a stent placed in one of your coronary\narteries to help keep it open.  Bronchoscopy was performed to\nlook at your airways; this test was normal.  You were also\ntreated with antibiotics for pneumonia. You were seen by our\npulmonary (lung) doctors, who recommended a course of steroids\nand nebulizers (breathing treatments). It is also possible that\none of your medications (rapamycin) was causing damage to your\nlungs, so we changed this medication to a different medicine\ncalled tacrolimus.\n.\nYou also have a condition called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\n(an occasional abnormal heart rhythm).  This puts you at a risk\nof having a stroke.  To prevent strokes, patients are often\nstarted on Coumadin (a blood thinner).  You should speak with\nyour outpatient doctors about starting this medication.  We are\nnot starting it in the hospital until you see the lung doctors\nin follow-up, in case they decide to do a procedure called a\nthoracentesis (to drain some fluid in part of your lung).\n.\nYou have follow-up with the lung doctors, heart doctors, and\nkidney doctors.\n\n****Please note that we have made MANY changes to your\nmedications during this hospitalization.  Listed below are the\nmedications you should take at discharge.  We have also listed\nthe reason for taking them.

At\napproximately 7 a.m. on the morning of admission, after which\ntime, he was found at 2:30 p.m. by his grandson to be on the\nfloor confused and acting inappropriately.  The patient was\ntaken to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of\n15 initially, but decreased to 14, and he was then intubated\nand sedated with need to protect the airway.  Soon after\nthis, he developed a seizure and wasgiven  vecuronium before\ntransfer to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital.  He also\nreceived Vitamin K and two units of fresh frozen plasma at\nthe outside hospital.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Multiple cerebral vascular accidents.\nHe is status post myocardial infarction.  He has a positive\nhistory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a\npositive history of alcohol use and two pack a day tobacco\nabuse.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has an allergy history reaction to penicillin\nand Benadryl and his current medications include Coumadin,\naspirin, metoprolol and Combivent.\n\nAt the time of admission and examination, he was intubated,\nsedated and paralyzed and the examiner was therefore unable\nto elicit a full neurological exam.\n\nCT scan from the outside hospital showed a large cerebellar\nhemorrhage with hydrocephalus.\n\nLABORATORIES:  His hematocrit was 40.6, white blood cell\ncount 8.4, platelet count 164,000.  His PT was 16, PTT 39,\nINR was 1.8 and this was after four units of fresh frozen\nplasma.  The INR had come down from an INR of 4.9 initially\nat the outside hospital.  His sodium was 133, potassium 4.7,\nchloride 95, co2 26, BUN 8, creatinine 0.8 and blood glucose\n130.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the clinical findings, the patient\nwas admitted urgently to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care\nUnit.  A ventricular drain was placed and the patient was\nplaced supine with head of bed slightly elevated and the\nventricular drain allowing from drainage of cerebrospinal\nfluid.  Patient was subsequently stabilized and was initially\nextubated and doing well, however, later on the [**6-4**],\nhe was reintubated for emesis and question of aspiration.  On\nthe [**6-5**], he was noted to be awake and moving all\nextremities but not clearly following commands.  The\nventricular drain was patent at approximately 10 cm above the\ntragus and he was otherwise considered stable.\n\nOn the 10th, he remained arousable, moving all four\nextremities and obeying commands, and on the 11th, he\nremained intubated and when propofol was turned off for\nneurological exam, the patient attempted to open his eyes to\nsternal rub. His legs bilaterally withdrew briskly to painful\nstimuli.  His left arm localized and he could stick out his\ntongue and wiggle his toes partially to command but was\nrequiring careful blood pressure monitoring and control, as\nwell as continued sedation and continued intubation.  On the\n12th, it was noted that the patient remained intubated,\nsedated, but was no longer responding to call or command.  CT\nscan was obtained and following this, a number of lengthy\ndiscussions were entered with the family and with a social\nworker present and decisions were made by the family to\nwithdraw care with consideration that they felt the family\nmember would not care to have his life sustained with all of\nthe necessary medical interventions that were being taken and\nwith the poor prognosis.  For that reason, and with the\nfamily's consent and request, the patient was subsequently\nextubated and converted to comfort measures only and care was\nessentially withdrawn other than for comfort measures and the\npatient subsequently died late on the [**2110-4-8**] with\nthe patient's family present and comfortable with this event.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.\n\n\n\n                                [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D. [**MD Number(1) 1133**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 5474**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2110-6-21**]  18:43\nT:  [**2110-6-21**]  18:43\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 38725**]\n\"\n13242,3182,192079,2125-12-03,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2125-11-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2125-12-3**]\n\nDate of Birth:                    Sex:\n\nService:  C-MED\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 74 year-old female\nwith history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular\ndisease, aortic patch and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus\nwho has had a coronary artery bypass graft with multiple\ncatheterizations as well as recent increase in her anginal\nsymptoms.

Chest pain was felt to\nbe consistent with acute coronary syndrome versus aortic\ndissection especially with the history of aortic patch.\nPatient was cycled with serial enzymes and did rule in for\nmyocardial infarction by enzymes, was continued on her\nstatin, Nitropaste and Imdur, on metoprolol and Zestril and\nincreased dose of Lasix for mild degree of failure.  On\n[**2125-11-29**] patient developed 10 out of 10 chest pain\nradiating to the neck with severe shortness of breath.\nVitals were 89 percent on 2 liters of O2.  She was then given\na nonrebreather, Lopressor 5 mg intravenous times two, 4 mg\nof morphine, 2 mg of Ativan.  Her vitals were then 100\npercent on nonrebreather with stable blood pressure and\npulse.  Laboratories showed troponin of 3.2, arterial blood\ngases showing a gas of pO2 161, CO2 of 53.  Chest x-ray\nshowed bilateral pulmonary edema.  Patient was transferred to\nthe Cardiac Care Unit for further management.  She was\ncontinued on heparin, nitro drip as well as all of her home\nmedications and no further episodes of chest pain.  Patient\nunderwent catheterization on [**2125-11-30**] which had a PTCA\nand stent of the SVG to LAD and anastomosis distal to graft\ntouchdown.  SVG to RCA showed no evidence of stenosis.  There\nwas a tight ostial and proximal left circumflex which was not\nstented secondary to dye load that was given and patient was\ntransferred back to the Cardiac Care Unit for monitoring\nuntil further catheterization on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2125-12-3**].\nOver the weekend she had no significant events and underwent\ncardiac catheterization on [**2125-12-3**].  Cardiac\ncatheterization on [**2125-12-3**] with an attempt to\nintervene on the left circumflex.  However, due to difficulty\npassing wire through the left circumflex artery lesion there\nwas no intervention that was done.  Post procedure patient\nwas doing well.  However, after the sheath was pulled she\nbegan to develop a large groin hematoma around noon on\n[**2125-12-3**].  Patient had a significant groin hematoma\nwhich began to expand, was given blood as well as several\nliters of intravenous fluid.  The interventional fellow was\npresent and attempted to put pressure on the femoral artery.\nHowever, the hematoma was large and the patient's body\nhabitus prevented adequate hemostasis.  Patient was\ntransferred up to the Cardiac Care Unit for evaluation and\ntreatment.  Arterial line was placed for further monitoring\nof her blood pressure and patient was noted to be severely\nhypotensive.  Blood pressure readings were difficult to\ncorrelate with cuff measurements as patient's cuff\nmeasurements were fluctuating wildly from 60 systolic to 120\nsystolic.  Arterial line measurements were the ones that were\nused for evaluation and treatment.  Patient was started on\nDopamine as well as Levophed for increasing her systolic\npressure.  However, she was failing to respond to both of\nthese.  Over 4 liters of intravenous saline were given to her\nwith little improvement in systolic blood pressure.  Patient\nwas taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory which was\nperformed as an emergent catheterization by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\nwith fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 46**] present.  Left sided cardiac\ncatheterization showed occlusion 100 percent of the left main\ncoronary artery, SVG to the LAD was 100 percent occluded, SVG\nto the RCA was not injected due to cardiac arrest.\nImmediately upon establishing arterial accessed patient began\nto develop refractory ventricular tachycardia and pulseless\nelectrical activity.  Attempt was made to PTCA the occluded\nSVG to LAD but while preparing equipment patient became\nasystolic.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and\npatient coded for about 25 minutes.  Despite multiple doses\nof intravenous epinephrine, atropine, calcium chloride,\nbicarbonate patient remained in PA for more than 20 minutes\nwith no return of any visible cardiac activity by\nfluoroscopy.

He did not notice any improvement\nand his fevers continued, so he decided to come to the hospital.\n\nIn the ER his pain was [**10-5**], T 99.6 F, HR 137 BPM, BP 96/64\nmmHg, RR 30 X', SpO2 100%. His initial abdominal exam reported\nsevere abdominal pain and inflammed R knee joint. Patient\ninitially received Flagyl and underwent non-contrast abdominal\nCT scan that did not show any perforation, obstruction or acute\npathology. Arthrosenthesis shwoed 16,600 WBC with 98% PMNs, no\norganisms as well as few needle-shaped negatively birefringent\ncrystals. Pt received \"\"stress dose steroids\"\" with Solumedrol 125\nmg. His CXR showed a RML infiltrate. At this point patient\nreceived Vanc/Levo/CTX. His BP was as los as 90/60 mmHg and\ntachycardia up to 130s. He responded to 4 L NS fluid. Given that\nCT scan showed pericardial effusion, cardiolgy consult was done,\nwho performed an echocardiogram that did not show signs of\ntamponade. No pulsus was done. Transplant surgery and nephrology\nwere called, but did not see patient. T [**Age over 90 **] F, BP 110/66 mmHg,\nSpO2 96% 2L. he is being admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic\nmonitoring.\n\nOf note, patient undergoes labs every other week at [**Hospital 882**]\nHospital and results get faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2106**] and his PCP. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]\n[**4-19**] his creatinine was 3.54, gap of 14 with Na 139, K 4.7, Cl\n103, CO2 22, BUN 70. Pt had normal LFTs (AST 28, ALT 17), PTH\n149,  urine creatinine 37 and protein 109, HCT 30, PLT 189 and\nWBC 9.2.

Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a large\npericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No\nright ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief\nright atrial diastolic collapse.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-7-11**], a\npreviously very small pericardial effusion is now large in size.\nNo clear echocardiographic evidence for tamponade.\n\nCT abdomen/pelvis ([**2183-4-24**]):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Moderate simple-appearing pericardial effusion, new since\n[**2181-7-27**].\n2. Bibasilar ground-glass opacities consistent with aspiration\npneumonia.\n3. No evidence of small-bowel obstruction, free air or abscess\nformation.\n4. No abnormalities of the renal transplant on CT.\n5.

No evidence of abscess formation at the right iliac fossa\nrenal\ntransplant.\n\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST\tStudy Date of [**2183-4-25**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Multifocal predominantly basal airspace infiltrate with some\nassociated\natelectasis, concerning for infection. Follow up with CXR is\nrecommended.\n2. Moderate-sized pericardial effusion.\n3. No definate evidence for malignancy within the chest.\n4. Healing seventh posterior right-sided rib fracture.\n\n[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT [**2183-4-28**]\nRegional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a large\npericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.\nThere is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There is\nsignificant, accentuated respiratory variation in\nmitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired\nventricular filling.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-4-24**],\nmitral inflow views suggest impaired filling. The size and\nlocation of the pericardial effusion (mostly posterior) are\nsimilar.\n\nCardiac Cath  [**2183-4-28**]\nCOMMENTS:\n1.  Pericardiocentesis via the apical approach under\nechocardiographic\nguidance with confirmation of catheter placement via flouroscopy\nand\ninjection of agitated saline was performed. The initial mean\npericardial\npressure was 14 mmHg, which declined to 8 mmHg after drainage of\n320 cc\nof clear red-tinged fluid.  Follow-up echocardiography\ndemonstrated\ngross resolution of the effusion.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Successful pericardiocentesis via apical approach.\n\n[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT [**2183-4-28**]\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThere is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are\nno echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\nIMPRESSION: Prior to pericardiocentesis, there is a moderate to\nlarge circumferential pericardial effusion.\nPost-pericardiocentesis, there is a trivial/physiologic\npericardial effusion located near the infero-lateral wall. There\nare no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\n[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT\nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular chamber size and free\nwall motion are normal. There is a very small pericardial\neffusion; the pericardial space is somewhat echodense consistent\nwith probable organization. The pericardium appears thickened.\nThe echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of\npericardial constriction.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-4-28**], the\npericardial effusion is now much smaller.\n\nCHEST (PA & LAT) [**2183-4-30**]\nIMPRESSION: Removal of pericardial drain with increase in\ncardiac diameter\nand increased retrocardiac atelectasis, suggesting\nreaccumulation of\npericardial fluid. Increasing left pleural effusion. The right\nlung opacity\nis unchanged and might correspond to a parenchymal opacity\nadjacent to a known\nrib fracture documented on the CT examination of [**2183-4-25**].\n\n[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT   [**2183-5-2**]\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve\nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.\nThere is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are\nno echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\nCompared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)\nof [**2183-4-29**], no major change.\n\nCHEST (PA & LAT) [**2183-5-2**]\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Finding suggestive of possible reaccumulation of pericardial\neffusion.\n2. Persistent large left pleural effusion with compressive\natelectasis.\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\t[**2183-5-2**]\nNo pneumothorax is detected. Compared with [**2183-5-2**], no\nsignificant change is\ndetected. Again seen is the loculated pneumothorax at the left\nbase, with\nunderlying collapse and/or consolidation. Also again seen is the\n~26 mm\nnodular opacity in the right mid lung -- ? related to healing\nrib fracture, as seen on [**2183-4-25**] CT, vs an focal patchy\nparenchymal opacity also seen on CT.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - CKD Stage IV at baseline with\ncreatinine of 2.5-3.0. He arrived with creatinine 5.1, elevated\nfrom 3.5 the week prior. He had sharp upstroke of arterial\nwaveforms and increase of RIs compared to [**2182-9-26**], which was\ninitially concerning for possible rejection. The renal\ntransplant team was consulted and concluded that the most likely\ncause was to pre-renal renal failure in the setting of diarrhea\nand dehydration, with a contribution from the sirolimus level\nbeing elevated. Sirolimus was stopped, diuretic medications were\nstopped, he was given IVF and his AoCRF slowly resolved and\nreturned to baseline. He was started on myfortic once the\nsirolimus levels were <8 and tolerated this medication without\nside effects. Bactrim was not started while he was an inpatient\nbut a prescription for Bactrim SS was called in to his pharmacy\nand the patient informed of this.\n\n# Pericardial effusion - Patient was found to have new\npericardial effusion on presentation CT chest and then again on\nechocardiogram. On initial TTE there were no signs of tamponade\nand he was admitted to the MICU for closer monitoring. The\netiology was unclear and with broad differential. Multiple tests\nwere done to rule out infections, rheumatologic or malignant\nprocesses and were all negative (see result section for specific\ntests). Sirolimus was considered as a possible etiology for the\npericardial effusion as there had been case reports of this. He\nwas subsequently transferred to the floor were surveillance TTE\nrevealed early sign of tamponade. Due to this a cardiology\nconsult was obtained and the patient was taken to the cath lab\nfor urgent pericardiocentesis. He tolerated the procedure well\nand was transfered to the CCU for monitoring. While in the CCU\nhe developed AF with RVR that was treated with IV diltiazem and\nsubsequently converted to NSR. He was then transfered again to\nthe medical floor were he remained stable and repeat TTE\nrevealed a trivail effusion. His BP meds were adjusted (see\nmedication section for details).\n\n# Diarrhea - Patient with watery non-bloody diarrhea without any\nsick contacts, nausea or vomiting. Initially he had pain in his\nRLQ, where his transplant is located. Non-con CT scan did not\nshow acute pathology, but this study was limited given the lack\nof contrast. Patient was treated with Flagyl and his symptoms\nimproved. Flagyl was stopped after 2 days of treatment and\nsymptoms did not recur.\n\n# Pulmonary infiltrate - Patient had new infiltrate in RML\ncompared to prior CXRs. CT chest showed bibasilar ground-glass\nopacities. Since he is immunosuppressed he is at risk of\natypical infections. Pt had initially elevated lactate of 2.7\nthat normalized with fluids 0.8. Induced sputum was attempted 3\ntimes to check for PCP but this was unsuccessful. Patient was\nstarted on levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern of aspiration\nPNA. Additionally, he underwent video swallow study to assess\nfor aspiration risk. This showed no signs of aspiration and\nflagyl was stopped. He finished a 9 day course of levofloxacin\nand remained a febrile.\n\n# Gout - Pt had a gout flare in the setting of dehydration and\npossible infection. The right knee was tapped in the ED, fluid\nanalysis consistent with gout. No evidence of septic joint. Pt\nreceived steroids in the ER and was continued on his home dose\nof prednisone thereafter. His pain was treated with prn Dilaudid\nand it resolved on HD4.\n\n# Diabetes Mellitus type 2 - Last A1C of 5.9 on [**10-4**]. Patient\nwas continued on ISS. Glyburide was resumed when his clinical\nstatus improved.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia - LDL 52, HDL 66, Chol 153, TG 174.\nFurthermore, statins have shown decrease rejection rate and\npossibly better outcomes in in-hospital patients. We continued\nhis home dose statin during this admission.\n\n# Hypertension - Pt on Toprol XL 100 and amlodipine 5 mg daily\nat home. Initially his antihypertensives were held in the\nsetting of hypovolemia and ARF from diarrhea. Once stabilized,\nhe was started on metoprolol and this was titrated to HR/BP\ncontrol. He was discharged on 150 mg of metroprolol succinate\ndaily. Amlodipine was not restarted given that his BP was well\ncontrolled with the above regimen and concerns of worsening his\nLE edema.\n\n# Secondary Hyperparathyroidism - Secondary to chronic renal\nfailure Stage IV. We continued his home calcitriol but the\ndosing was changed to QOD.\n\n# Anemia: Patient was found to be anemic but remained at\nbaseline. Iron studies revealed anemia of chronic disease with\nlikely contribution from CKD. Iron repletion was stated.\nTreatment with epo should be considered as an outpatient.\n\n# Code - Full code\n\nMedications on Admission:\nProcrit 10,000 unit/mL QWeek\nRapamune 4.5 mg PO Daily\nPrednisone 10 mg Daily\nCalcium carbonate 500 mg PO TID\nAllopurinol 300 mg PO Daily\nCalcitriol 0.25 mcg PO Daily\nLasix 40 mg PO QOD\nSimvastatin 10 mg PO Daily\nOmeprazole 20 mg PO Daily\nGlipizide ER 2.5 mg PO Daily\nAmlodipine 5 mg PO Daily\nMetoprolol Succinate 100 mg PO Daily\nInsulin (humalog)\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

In general, the patient was in no acute\ndistress.  His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat were\nunremarkable.  He had no icterus.  His neck was supple with\njugular venous distention.  He did have bilateral carotid\nbruits.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His heart was\nregular in rate and rhythm without murmur, rubs or gallops.\nHis abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good\nbowel sounds.  His extremities had no edema.  His right foot\nhad a healing ulcer on the bottom of his heel and over the\nlateral malleolus.  His sternum incision showed erythema and\npurulent and sanguinous fluid staining the dressing with a\nsmall opening at the inferior portion of the incision.  The\nsternum was not stable.  The rectal examination was\nguaiac-positive.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories from\noutside hospital revealed a white blood cell count of 17.4,\nhematocrit of 32.8, platelets of 368 (85% polys, 6%\nlymphocytes, 9% monocytes).  Sodium of 138, potassium of 4.1,\nchloride of 96, bicarbonate of 28, blood urea nitrogen of 26,\ncreatinine of 0.9, glucose of 385.  INR of 7.4.  Urinalysis\nwas unremarkable.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted the\nSurgical Service.  On [**10-30**], the patient underwent\ndebridement and partial resection of his sternum.  The\nsternum wires were removed.  There was evidence of sternal\ndehiscence.  OR cultures and blood cultures grew out\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient\nwas placed on vancomycin.\n\nHe underwent an omental flap on [**11-11**].  This procedure\nwas delayed secondary to sepsis and hypotension requiring\npressors.  The patient was temporarily paralyzed and\nintubated.  Following the flap reconstruction, the patient\nremained intubated and developed a ventilatory-requiring\npneumonia.  A bronchoscopy on [**2116-11-19**] revealed a\npseudomass infection which was resistant to ceftazidime and\nimipenem but sensitive to cefepime.\n\nIn terms of his gastrointestinal bleeding, an upper endoscopy\nwas performed on [**11-17**] which showed normal mucosa to the\nduodenum.  The patient continued to have gastrointestinal\nbleeding, however, and on [**11-27**] underwent a colonoscopy\nshowing angiectasia of the rectum and radiation proctitis;\nhowever, this was not actively bleeding.\n\nOther events of significance during his hospitalization\nincluded direct current cardioversion on [**11-14**] for\natrial flutter.  The patient also had episodes of gross\nhematuria.  Urology was consulted and recommended outpatient\nfollowup.  The patient also developed a clot in the right\ninternal jugular that was identified by Doppler.  The patient\nalso developed bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient also\ndeveloped a splenic infarct while on pressors.\n\nOn [**11-30**], the patient was transferred from the Surgical\nService to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  It was felt that\nhis surgical issues had resolved.  However, the patient had\nmultiple medical problems at that time including failure to\nwean from the ventilator, ongoing pneumonia, and pleural\neffusions.\n\nAs far as his cardiac status at that time, he was noted to be\nin some congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic\nfunction.  He was placed on captopril at that time.\n\nAs far as his renal function, he had developed acute tubular\nnecrosis in the setting of hypotension from sepsis, and this\nwas slowly resolving.  He was grossly fluid overloaded,\nhowever.\n\nIn terms of his neurologic status, he had generalizes\nweakness and also had profound mental status changes.  He was\nalert but not responsive and would not follow commands.\n\nIn terms of his gastrointestinal status, the patient was on\nProtonix for his history of upper gastrointestinal bleed.\nHis hematocrit was stable at the time of his transfer to the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit.  As far as his hematuria, he\ncontinued to have intermittent hematuria attributed to Foley\ntrauma.\n\nThe remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was\nsignificant for his failure to wean off the ventilator and\nfor his change in mental status.\n\nAs far as his failure to wean, he was repeatedly attempted to\nwean.  Despite adequate treatment of his pneumonia, the\npatient would become extremely agitated and tachypneic on\ntrials of pressor support.\n\nAs far as his cardiac function, a repeat echocardiogram\nshowed moderately depressed systolic function, and the\npatient was continued on amiodarone, Lopressor, and an ACE\ninhibitor.\n\nThe patient was evaluated by the Neurology Service who felt\nthat his delta mental status was most likely multifactorial\nin the setting of his medical problems.  [**Name (NI) 6**] magnetic\nresonance imaging of the head showed no acute stroke or bleed\nbut had an old left cerebellar stroke and mild atrophy with\ndiffuse microvasculature ischemic changes and bilateral\nmastoid air cell disease.\n\nAs the patient's condition did not improve despite aggressive\ntreatment, and given his multiple medical problems and his\noverall poor prognosis, after an extensive discussion with\nthe patient's wife and her nieces, it was decided to withdraw\naggressive care and make the patient comfort measures only.\nIn this setting, the patient expired secondary to respiratory\nfailure and cardiac asystole on [**12-6**] at 5:43 p.m.\n\nDIAGNOSES AT DEATH:\n 1.

Past medical history is significant\nfor coronary artery disease status post percutaneous\ntransluminal coronary angioplasty with stent of the left\nanterior descending coronary artery in [**2138**].  Upon arrival to\nthe [**Hospital6 2910**], the patient reported\nconstant four out of ten chest pain with radiation to his jaw\nsince the previous evening, [**2144-9-8**].  He received\nmorphine prior to catheterization.  Catheterization\ndemonstrated a tight LAD lesion, 70% proximal, 90% mid LAD,\nresulting in an inability to see his previous LAD stent.  The\npatient continued to have chest pain status post\ncatheterization with no electrocardiogram changes evident.\nLeft ventriculogram during catheterization showed normal size\nand good contraction of all wall segments.  He was started on\na nitroglycerin intravenous drip at 80 mcg/minute, Aggrastat\nand heparin.  This resulted in a decrease in his chest pain\nto one to two out of ten in severity.  Labs drawn at [**Hospital6 14475**] showed a hematocrit of 39.0,\ncreatinine kinase of 126, troponin 0.06.  The patient was\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for\ntherapeutic catheterization.  Upon arrival vital signs were\n97.8, blood pressure 140 to 160 over 90 to 100, heart rate in\nthe 60's with normal sinus rhythm, oxygen saturation 98 to\n100% on two liters nasal cannula oxygen.  Prior to\ncatheterization at [**Hospital1 69**],\npatient received fentanyl 25 mcg for his discomfort and\nVersed.  Therapeutic catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**] showed left main coronary artery disease with\nmid ostial disease, left anterior descending with 60% ostial\nlesion, moderate 50% mid disease prior to stent, 95% tight\nfocal lesion in old stent prior to first major diagonal\nbranch.  A Cypher stent was deployed in the proximal/middle\nLAD.  Status post catheterization, the patient had\nserosanguinous blood discharge and ooze from around sheaths\nupon arrival to the floor.  Tunnel sheaths were pulled with\nsystolic blood pressures in the range of 140's to 150's.\nCardiac fellow applied pressure.  The patient complained of\nrecurrent pain so additional doses of morphine were given.\nAt this time then his right groin developed a large hematoma.\nSubsequently, nitroglycerin and Aggrastat were discontinued.\nIntravenous fluids were started with aggressive fluid\nhydration.  Stat hematocrit value was drawn with a value of\n34.9.  The patient's hematoma continued to expand and he\ncontinued to complain of pain.  As the hematoma and groin\ncontinued to ooze bloody discharge, a vascular groin C-clamp\nwas applied.  The patient was transferred to the Coronary\nCare Unit for further hemodynamic monitoring.  Upon arrival\nto the CCU, he complained of severe pain, greater than ten\nout of ten in severity.  Upon arrival he then received\nanother 10 mg of morphine, 1 mg of Versed, 50 mcg of fentanyl\nand Phenergan 25 mg IV.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

The latest hematocrit value from\n[**2144-8-12**] was 39.0.\n\nELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Dipyridamole EKG ([**2144-8-25**]):  Normal sinus\nrhythm, left atrial enlargement, incomplete right bundle\nbranch block, left anterior hemiblock but inconclusive\ndipyridamole exercise EKG.  No chest pain or diagnostic ST\nsegment changes to heart rate of 101.\n\nCARDIOLITE STRESS TEST ([**2144-8-25**]):  Normal left ventricular\nsize and function.  Ejection fraction 58%.  Anterior wall\nthinning consistent with prior non-transmural myocardial\ninfarction.  Inferior basal wall ischemia.\n\nELECTROCARDIOGRAM [**2144-9-9**] AT [**Hospital6 **]:\nShowed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute.  Left axis\ndeviation.  Borderline PR interval.  Right bundle branch\nblock.  Left anterior fascicular block.  Poor R-wave\nprogression.  Poor voltage in limb leads.\n\nCORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**2144-9-9**]):  Demonstrated selective\nleft-sided coronary angiography in this left dominant\ncirculation demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.\nThe left main coronary artery had a 30% ostial lesion.  The\nleft anterior descending had serial lesions, with a tubular\n60% proximal, 50% mid prior to the old stent, mild in-stent\nre-stenosis leading into a 95% lesion at the distal end of\nthe stent.  The left circumflex had mild luminal irregularity\nand gave off an OM1 with moderate diffuse disease.  The right\ncoronary artery was not engaged.  Successful stenting of the\nmain left anterior descending was performed with a 3.5 x 18\nmm Cypher (drug alluding stent).\n\nECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2144-9-10**]):  Left ventricular ejection fraction\n60%.  The left atrium is normal in size.  Left ventricular\ncavity size and systolic function are normal.  The ascending\naorta is mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets (three)\nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no\naortic regurgitation.  The mitral valve leaflets are\nstructurally normal.  No mitral regurgitation is seen.  The\nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.\nThere is a small pericardial effusion.  There is no 2-D\nechocardiographic findings of tamponade, but a complete\nDoppler assessment was not possible.\n\nARTERIAL DOPPLERS OF THE RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ([**2144-9-10**]).\nDuplex evaluation performed of the right lower extremity\narterial and venous systems with concentration on the\ninguinal region.  Impression was that of a large right groin\nhematoma.  There was no evidence of obvious pseudo-aneurysm\nor arteriovenous fistula.\n\nREPEAT RIGHT VASCULAR ULTRASOUND OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY\n([**2144-9-4**]):  Again, there was a large right femoral hematoma\nwhich demonstrates heterogeneous echotexture.  The right\ncommon femoral artery and vein are patent demonstrating\nnormal vascular flow.  There is no evidence of\npseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient with known history of\ncoronary artery disease status post coronary catheterization\ntimes two on [**2144-9-9**], status post stent placement in\nthe proximal/mid left anterior descending artery.  Plan was\nmade to continue aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor and folate.  It was\nunclear originally why the patient was not on a beta blocker.\nTherefore, once his blood pressure was able to tolerate\nadditional antihypertensives, a low dose beta blocker was\nadded to his medication regimen.  We started him on\nmetoprolol, titrating up the dose to desired effect.\nInitially many of the patient's antihypertensive medications\nincluding Catapres and Accupril were held secondary to the\nquestionable hemodynamic instability resulting from his right\ngroin hematoma and blood loss anemia.  After stabilization of\nhis intravascular volume status post multiple transfusions,\nand several days of monitoring, the patient was restarted on\nmetoprolol and captopril.  After several days of monitoring,\nthe patient continued to be hypertensive with blood pressures\nranging 160 to 180 over 90's to 100.  Therefore the doses of\nthe captopril and metoprolol were titrated up.  The captopril\nwas switched to longer acting lisinopril.  At the time of\ndischarge the patient's blood pressure was controlled on\nmetoprolol 100 b.i.d., lisinopril 40 q. day and\nhydrochlorothiazide 25 q. day.\n\nThe patient continued to be monitored on telemetry with no\nevidence of acute conduction abnormalities.  After the\ncomplaint of chest pain on the first day of admission with no\ndemonstrable electrocardiographic changes, the patient\nremained chest pain free for the remainder of this admission.\n\n2.  Right groin hematoma resulting in blood loss anemia:\nVascular Surgery consultation was obtained status post\ncoronary catheterization and development of large right groin\nhematoma.  Vascular Surgery recommended a lower extremity\nultrasound with results as above, namely, ultrasound\ndemonstrated a large right groin hematoma, no evidence of\npseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.  In the\nCoronary Care Unit, serial hematocrits were obtained,\npatient's blood pressure and hemodynamics were checked\nserially and peripheral pulse checks were done q. one hour.\nDue to anemia secondary to blood loss, the patient required\nmultiple blood transfusions for stabilization of his blood\nvolume and maintenance of hematocrit greater than 30.  All\ntold he received five units of blood.  Initially also he was\nkept on bed rest with Foley catheter in place and his right\nleg immobilized.  His pain was treated with morphine,\nfentanyl and Versed initially.  After several days it was\nswitched over to Vicodin as the patient uses Vicodin at home\nfor control of his lower back pain.  Repeat ultrasound was\nobtained on [**2144-9-4**], with no evidence of hematoma\nexpansion, no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous\nfistula formation.  Upon discharge, the patient's hematoma\nsize was stabilized.  Serial hematocrits had been stable\nabove 33 to 36 for several days.  As the patient's hematoma\nresolved within a prolonged period of immobilization, it was\nfelt that discharge to a rehabilitation facility where he\ncould work on functional mobility and increasing gait and\nbalance was warranted.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Fair.  Right groin hematoma size\nstable.  Hematocrit stabilized.  Unable to demonstrate full\npre-hospital functionality, so discharge to rehab.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient discharge to extended care\nfacility, rehab program.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.

He can call\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 25832**] for an appointment and was given this\ninformation.  Additionally, he was told to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] for\na follow-up appointment at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2394**] within the following\ntwo to three weeks.  The patient was instructed that we have\nchanged several of his pre-hospital medications, particularly\nthose controlling his blood pressure.  He was instructed to\ndiscard his Catapres patch, Lasix and Accupril prescriptions.\nHe was instructed that we have added metoprolol, lisinopril\nand hydrochlorothiazide to his blood pressure regimen.  He is\ninstructed to take them as directed.  Additionally, he was\ninstructed that he must take daily aspirin and Plavix for the\nnext nine months.  He was instructed that if he misses any\ndoses, the risk of his coronary stents occluding dramatically\nincreases.\n\n\n\n\n                            [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD  [**MD Number(1) 21980**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 257**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2144-9-15**]  20:42\nT:  [**2144-9-15**]  20:39\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 27867**]\n\ncc:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 27868**]\"\n17084,10408,135511,2146-09-28,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2146-9-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2146-9-28**]\n\nDate of Birth:   [**2088-1-26**]     Sex:  M\n\nService:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] MICU\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year old male with\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia, status post allo bone marrow\ntransplant in [**2146-4-5**] with a very complicated course.

Folate.\n8.  Prilosec.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of\n99.7, heart rate 110, blood pressure 108/60, respiratory rate\n24, oxygen saturation 94% on four liters.  General - Alert,\nill appearing, in no acute distress.  The pupils are equal,\nround, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular\nmovements are intact.  Dry mucous membranes.  Positive oral\nthrush.  The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.\nCardiovascular is tachycardic, hyperdynamic, no murmurs.  The\nlungs revealed wet crackles bilaterally.  The abdomen is\nsoft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.\nExtremities revealed 1+ pitting edema.  Skin is diffusely\nerythematous and desquamating.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was\n2.0, hematocrit 33.0, platelet count 49,000.  Unremarkable\nChem7.  Liver function tests are remarked for alkaline\nphosphatase of 770 and LDH 421.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the\nregular medical floor with fevers and watery diarrhea.  He\nreceived fluids with no significant improvement.  He also had\nsome broad spectrum antibiotics including Cefepime,\nVancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  On the medical floor,\nthe patient continued to have worsening hypoxia which was not\nimproving despite numerous medical interventions.  He was\nthen transferred to the Intensive Care Unit after he\ndeveloped hemoptysis and hypoxia with oxygen saturation\nunable to improve on noninvasive ventilation.  Initial gases\nrevealed acidosis with mild hypercapnia and good oxygenation.\n\nIn the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was placed on non-\ninvasive mask ventilation with the hope that this would improve\nhis pulmonary status. His presumptive diagnosis was diffuse\noverall hemorrhage based on the fact that he is a post bone\nmarrow transplant patient and on his hemoptysis.  The patient had\npreviously very clearly stated that he is DNR/DNI and did not\nwish any intubation.  He did not improve after four days of non-\ninvasive mask ventilation with at times worsening hypoxia and\nhypercapnia. He was maintained on all antibiotics and no clear\nsource of infection was identified.  On [**2146-9-28**], the patient\ndeveloped an episode of hypotension that was not responding to\nfluids. He became hypoxic and required increased FIO2 to 100.\nDespite repeated fluid boluses, he went profoundly\nhypotensive and his mental status was declining.  After\ndiscussion with the family, the decision was made to make the\npatient comfort measures only.  The patient was started on\nFentanyl drip and expired at 11:05 on [**2146-9-28**].\n\n\n\n\n                          [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 5094**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2146-9-28**]  13:59\nT:  [**2146-10-1**]  10:06\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 48027**]\n\"\n14878,50629,183318,2124-12-27,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2124-12-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-12-27**]\n\nDate of Birth:  [**2061-12-2**]             Sex:   M\n\nService: CARDIOTHORACIC\n\nAllergies:\nLisinopril\n\nAttending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]\nChief Complaint:\nRight lower lobe lung cancer\n\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n[**2124-12-15**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage,\nright thoracotomy and right lower lobectomy with sleeve\nbronchoplasty (tubular bronchoplasty of the right middle lobe\nfor reanastomosis), mediastinal lymph node dissection,\nintercostal muscle flap buttress, and pericardial flap buttress.\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nMr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with a right lower lobe\nsquamous cell carcinoma with endobronchial invasion at the level\nof the superior segment and distal bronchus intermedius. He had\nundergone previous cervical mediastinoscopy which was negative\nfor any mediastinal nodal disease. He then underwent 8 weeks of\npulmonary rehab. He symptomatically felt much better though his\npost rehab pulmonary function tests were still severely impaired\nwith an FEV1 of 47% of predicted and a DLCO 50% of predicted.\nHis cardiopulmonary exercise testing, however, revealed a VO2\nmax of 21.8 mL/kg per minute.  He was admitted for lobectomy or\npossible bilobectomy with the help that we could simply do a\nright lower lobectomy; but in order to get an adequate bronchial\nmargin, this would likely require a tubular bronchoplasty or\nreanastomosis of the right middle lobe onto the bronchus\nintermedius.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.

She has been married for over fifty\nyears.  No ETOH, tobacco or drug history.  Most recently, she\nhas resided at [**Hospital **] Nursing Home.  Minimal verbalization\nat baseline since cerebrovascular accident.  Her daughter is\nvery involved in her care.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 96.6,\nheart rate 96 and in atrial fibrillation, blood pressure\n106/42 with a MAP of 63, CVP of 6, respiratory rate 18,\noxygen saturation 100% on 50% face mask.  Examination is\nnotable for thin elderly woman looking acutely ill.  Surgical\npupil on the right.  The pupil is reactive on the left.\nSclera anicteric, mucous membranes are moist.  Strong gag.\nNo jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy. The heart is\nirregular and rapid, no murmurs.  Lungs revealed coarse\nbreath sounds and diffuse rhonchi.  The abdomen is soft,\nnondistended, nontender, gastrostomy tube in place.\nExtremities showed no edema, 2+ pulses.  Neurologically,\ndense hemiparesis of the right side with upgoing toe on the\nright and downing toe on the left and moving left extremities\nwithout difficulty.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was\n14.8, hematocrit 44.0, platelet count 350,000.  Chem7 was\nnormal except for glucose of 149, CK 167, troponin 0.04.\nUrinalysis notable for many bacteria, [**12-8**] white blood\ncells, moderate leukocytes.\n\nChest x-ray revealed retrocardiac density and bibasilar\natelectasis.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at\n137 beats per minute, left axis deviation, 0.[**Street Address(2) 11725**]\ndepressions V3 and V4, T wave inversion in leads I and aVL.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Infectious disease - The patient was initially started on\nbroad spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and\nFlagyl in the setting of sepsis.  Eventually, urine cultures\ngrew resistant proteus and sputum cultures grew Methicillin\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli.  Her antibiotic\ncoverage was eventually changed to Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone\nto which she responded well.  She should complete a ten day\ncourse of each.\n\n2.  Cardiac - Pump - The patient was initially septic and dry\non admission and was treated aggressively with multiple\nboluses of intravenous fluids.  She subsequently developed\nevidence of pulmonary edema, not surprisingly since her\nejection fraction is 20%.  She was then started on Lasix for\ndiuresis which eventually evoked hypotension and she was felt\nto be dry.  Total length of stay she is positive eight liters\nin the Intensive Care Unit.  At this point, her goal is even\nfluid balance. She will be restarted on her baseline Lasix.\n\nRate - The patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation on\nadmission, unclear of the duration of her atrial\nfibrillation, however, she has never been anticoagulated per\nprimary care physician because of risk of falls.  The patient\nhad a left middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident in\n[**5-21**], thought to be embolic in nature.  She has not been\nanticoagulated since that time due to concern for rebleed.\nAtrial fibrillation has been controlled initially with\nDiltiazem drip but she was then changed to p.o. beta blocker\nwith good rate control with heart rate in the 80s.  The\npatient was started on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous twice a day\nfor anticoagulation.\n\nIschemia - The patient had non ST elevation myocardial\ninfarction in the setting of sepsis and rapid atrial\nfibrillation.  Electrocardiographic changes resolved with\nheart rate control.  The patient was continued on Aspirin,\nbeta blocker and Lipitor.\n\n2.  Status post cerebrovascular accident - According to the\nfamily, the patient has been only minimally verbal since\ncerebrovascular accident.  They do feel that they can\ncommunicate with her and understand what she is trying to\ncommunicate.  There seems to have been little improvement in\nher function since [**Month (only) 116**].\n\n3.  Access - The patient had a right IJ placed on admission\nwhich remained throughout her hospital course.  She had no\nerythema or infection felt to be associated with the line.\n\n4.  Code Status - Code on admission, the patient was full\ncode.  She never did require intubation or CPR.  Multiple\ndiscussions with the family were undertaken while the patient\nwas in the Intensive Care Unit with the result that the\npatient was made DNR/DNI as documented on [**2129-12-10**], in the\nchart.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient will be discharged to an\nextended care facility.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should continue\nVancomycin intravenously until [**2129-12-17**].  She will continue\nCeftriaxone or p.o. equivalent to end on [**2129-12-21**].  In\naddition, she should continue on Lovenox for anticoagulation\nand her beta blocker should be titrated for adequate heart\nrate control.  Tube feeds to be continued and the patient\nwill need physical therapy.  In addition, her weight should\nbe monitored closely for evidence of weight gain at which\ntime her Lasix should be intermittently increased.  The\npatient may also require chest physical therapy\nintermittently to help handle her secretions.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\n1.  Bisacodyl 10 mg p.r.n.\n2.  Atorvastatin 10 mg once daily.\n3.

The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The\ngallbladder is partially filled with sludge, but there are no\nsigns of cholecystitis. The pancreas is mostly obscured by\noverlying bowel gas. The spleen is not imaged on this exam. The\nright kidney measures 11.1 cm and the left kidney measures 10.4\ncm. There is no hydronephrosis and no solid masses are\nidentified in either kidney. There is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm\nsimple cyst identified in the lower pole of the right kidney.\nThere is no ascites identified but there is a right pleural\neffusion seen.\n\nGrayscale and Doppler images of the aorta in the midline are\nvery limited due to the patient's overlying bowel gas. There is\nsome flow in the aorta, but it is difficult to assess. At its\nwidest diameter, the aorta measures 4.2 x 4.5 cm. The surgical\ngraft is not identified on this examination. Arterial flow is\nidentified in the right kidney with appropriate waveforms in the\nhilum. No flow is identified in the left kidney, but this may be\ndue to the fact that the left kidney is more difficult to\nvisualize.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Very limited views of the aorta show some flow within it.\nEvaluation of the graft is not possible on this examination due\nto the patient's abdominal distention and bowel gas.\n\n2. Sludge in the gallbladder with no signs of cholecystitis.\n\n3. Right pleural effusion.\n\n[**2102-12-21**] 12:37 PM\n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\n\nFINDINGS: AP single view of the chest (two exposures to cover\nentire chest area) were obtained with the patient in supine\nposition and analyzed in direct comparison with a similar\npreceding study of [**2102-12-19**]. The heart size remains\nwithin normal limits. The thoracic aorta is identified including\nthe bulging portion in the distal lower portion of the thoracic\naorta, which previously had been identified at the beginning\nsite of the thoraco-abdominal aneurysm. On previous examination,\nlinear atelectatic markings of the left lung have regressed\nmarkedly and there is no suspicion for any remaining major\natelectasis or pulmonary infiltrates surrounding the repaired\naneurysmatic area. Also, the right basal densities have\ndecreased and the right lateral pleural sinus is free. No new\nparenchymal infiltrates are identified and no evidence of\npulmonary vascular congestive pattern exists. No pneumothorax.\nPreviously described right jugular approach central venous line\nin unchanged position terminating overlying the superior\nmediastinum at the second anterior rib junction.\n\nMarkedly improved postoperative chest. Lateral view could give\ninformation concerning possibly remaining posterior pleural\nfluid.\n\n4.

There is\nnormal compression, color flow, waveforms, and augmentation.\nThere is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the lower\nextremities.\n\n[**2102-12-21**] 5:50 PM\n\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST\n\nReason: assess anastomotic sites/ assess for infiltrates/ fluid\n[**Last Name (un) **]\n\nFINDINGS: Significant increase in mediastinal lymph node size is\npresent at all mediastinal and hilar stations including the\nright upper paratracheal, from 4.4 to 9 mm, right lower\nparatracheal, from 4 to 10 mm and from 5 to 11 mm, and in\nsubcarinal area, from 7 to 16 mm. This increase might be\nreactive to infection and/or aspiration new since both the\n[**11-15**] CT and chest radiograph earlier today, specifically\nright perihilar, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe areas\nof peribronchial infiltration and more peripheral\nconsolidations. The airways are patent to the level of\nsubsegmental bronchi but endobronchial secretions in the\nbronchus intermedius and right lower lobe and segmental bronchi\nmight represent aspiration.\n\nLeft lower lobe linear opacity most likely is due to atelectasis\nsecondary to small pleural effusion. The right pleural effusion\nis also noted, small as well. The patient is after right lower\nlobe surgery, most likely wedge.\n\nThe heart size is enlarged with small pericardial effusion,\nnonhemorrhagic, new compared to [**2102-11-15**]. Myocardial\ndensity is significantly higher than the density of the blood in\nthe left ventricle suggesting anemia. Large thoracic aortic\naneurysm up to 6.7 cm in diameter is grossly unchanged, 6.5 cm\non the previous study, representing known fusiform thoracic\naortic aneurysm.\n\nThe imaged portion of the upper abdomen is limited for\nevaluation due to the absence of oral and IV contrast. The\ngallbladder is distended up to 4.2 cm. The abdominal aorta is\nonly partially imaged with a new fluid collection in front of\nit, 2:74, nonhemorrhagic by measurement of its radiodensity.\nThere is no free intraperitoneal air, clips at the level of the\nSMA most likely related to recent surgery.\n\nA stent in the left carotid is noted, unchanged. There are no\nbone lesions suspicious for malignancy. Healed fracture in the\nfifth right rib most likely related to thoracic surgery.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Limited assessment of post-surgical changes due to incomplete\nevaluation of the operation site and absence of oral contrast.\n2. Pre-aortic fluid collection of unknown clinical significance.\nIf clinically warranted, further evaluation with\ncontrast-enhanced study is recommended.\n3. New right middle and right lower lobe consolidations\nconsistent with infection versus aspiration. New bilateral small\npericardial effusion.\n4. Unchanged descending thoracic aorta aneurysm.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 43933**],[**Known firstname 177**] [**Numeric Identifier 43934**] was admitted on [**2102-12-12**] with  AAA. He\nagreed to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, he was\nconsented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were\nobtained,  all other preperations were made.\n\nHe underwent a Right iliofemoral conduit placement and SMA-ilio\nright and left renal artery bypasses with ligation of the origin\nof the SMA and right and left renal arteries. This was done in\npreleration of an endovascular procedure to be scheduled in the\nfuture.\n\nHe was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for\nsurgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and\nremained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well\nwithout any difficulty or complication.\n\nPost-operatively, he was transfered to the CVICU for further\ncare. Pt was eeventually weaned from pressure support and\nextubated. Once stable from the initial surgery, pt was\ntransfered to the VICU for further management.\n\nWhile in the VICU he recieved monitered care. When stable, he\nwas delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained.\n\nIt was noticed that the pt had an increase in his LFT. A\ntransplant surgery consult was obtained. Pt received a RU US.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Very limited views of the aorta show some flow within it.\nEvaluation of the graft is not possible on this examination due\nto the patient's abdominal distention and bowel gas.\n\n2. Sludge in the gallbladder with no signs of cholecystitis.\n\n3. Right pleural effusion.\n\n4. Small simple cyst in the right kidney\n\nOn DC his LFT are in a downtrend. Transplant ok'd for Dc with no\nfollow -up. Py diod have serial abdominal exams. Much\nimprovement.\n\nPT also was thought to have VT arrest. He was resusitated\nwithout intubation. A cardiology and EP consult was obtained.\n\nThe final consensus was - Upon review of tele/ECG's episode\nconsisted of sinus tachycardia in setting of baseline IVCD with\nmultiple PVCs\n\nHe was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative care,\nhe was transfered to floor status.\n\nOn the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain\ncontrolled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve her\nstrength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress\nwithout any incidents. He was discharged to a rehabilitation\nfacility in stable condition.\n\nTo note pt has to follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for furthe\ntreatment of AAA.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n[**Last Name (un) 1724**]: asa, plaivx, dig, hctz, lisinopril, lopressor, prozac,\nzocor, albuterol, advair,\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

She had a left internal mammary\ncoronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery,\nsaphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein\ngraft to posterior descending coronary artery.  She was\ntransferred to the Recovery Room with a mean arterial\npressure of 65, CVP of 22 in normal sinus rhythm with a rate\nof 53 on Propofol at 30 micrograms per kilogram per minute,\nneo 0.5 micrograms per kilogram per minute, insulin at 1.\n\nPostoperatively in the Intensive Care Unit she required\nmultiple boluses, but remained hemodynamically stable.  She\nwas also given some _________ ______ 500 cc.  She remained on\nneo, which was weaned and remained with a cardiac output of\ngreater then 4 with a cardiac index of around approximately\n2.  She was extubated in the evening of the first\npostoperative night, which she tolerated well.  Chest tubes\nremained in 20 cm of water.  She was also continued on an\ninsulin drip overnight.  She remained stable the next morning\nand was transferred to the floor for the remainder of her\nrecovery.  On postoperative day number two her JP chest tube\nand wires were discontinued.  On postoperative day number\nthree she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid\nventricular response.  She was given Lopressor po.  Her\nelectrolytes were repleted.  Her blood pressure remained\nstable in the 120s, 140s/70s.  She was loaded with\nAmiodarone.  She then on postoperative day number three again\nhad an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.  Her blood\npressure remained stable at 138/75.  She was given Amiodarone\nand Lopressor and her rate responded appropriately.\n\nShe was started on Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.\nCurrently her INR is 2.5.  She remains in sinus rhythm.  On\npostoperative day number 7 after beginning anticoagulation\nthe patient developed some vaginal spotting.  Given her\nhistory of endometrial cancer, a Gyn consult was obtained.\nTheir evaluation was that the bleeding was stable.  There was\nno need to proceed to hysterectomy at this time.  They\nsuggested the patient be continued on anticoagulation and\nwill be followed up by her Gyn in six months and that her\ncondition is likely stable.  The patient's anticoagulation\nwas continued.  She is therapeutic.  She remained in sinus\nrhythm.  During this time she is also been evaluated by\nphysical therapy.  She is currently at a level activity of 3.\nShe has remained hemodynamically stable and is now ready for\ndischarge to rehabilitation.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.

Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.\nExtremities:  Warm, noncyanotic, nonedematous times four.\nNeurological:  Grossly intact.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for coronary\nartery bypass grafting times four.  The procedure was\nperformed on [**2102-12-26**] and complicated in the immediate\npostoperative period by bleeding.  The patient was taken back\nto the Operating Room for reexploration.  A mammary artery\nbleeder was identified and controlled.\n\nSubsequent to this, the patient was taken to the ICU for\nclose monitoring.  The patient was transfused 8 units of\npacked red blood cells, 2 in the OR, 9 units of fresh frozen\nplasma, 3 units of platelets, 1 unit of cryo.\n\nIn the ICU, the patient was extubated without difficulty on\n[**2102-12-28**].  An episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with\nconversion back to normal sinus rhythm with 5 mg of IV\nLopressor and 150 mg IV Amiodarone.\n\nOn postoperative day number four, the patient was transferred\nto the floor.  On postoperative day number five, the patient\nwent into sustained rapid atrial fibrillation but was\nhemodynamically stable, converted to normal sinus after 10 mg\nof IV Lopressor and 400 mg of p.o. Amiodarone.\nAnticoagulation was then begun for recurrent atrial\nfibrillation episodes.  The sternal wound was seen to be\ndraining serosanguinous for a number of days and Plastic\nSurgery was consulted on postoperative day number 13.\n\nThe patient was deemed a good candidate for flap procedure\nfor wound breakdown and transfused 4 units of fresh frozen\nplatelets preoperative.  A pectoral advancement flap was\nperformed on postoperative day number 14.  Wound cultures\nsent at that time ultimately grew coagulase-negative\nStaphylococcus and probable Enterococcus from the superficial\nswab.  The deep swab remained without growth.  The patient\nwas maintained on Levaquin, vancomycin and Flagyl subsequent\nto the flap procedure.  The patient was monitored in the ICU\nand had an uneventful course.\n\nSubsequently, the patient was again transferred to the floor\non postoperative day number 19 with the left IJ central\nvenous line noted to be nonfunctioning.  This line was\nchanged over a wire with an x-ray showing coiling of the new\nCVL, probably secondary to pectoral flap.  The CVL was then\ndiscontinued and re-sighted to the right subclavian.\n\nThe patient then had an episode of sinus bradycardia which\nwas evaluated by Cardiology.  They thought this to be part of\na \"\"tachy/brady syndrome\"\".  They recommended no changes in\nmanagement except to avoid negative dromotropic and negative\nchronotropic drugs.  Lopressor was stopped.\n\nThe patient, after this, had an uneventful course and was\nmaintained with wound dressing changes per Plastics and JP\ndrains for drainage.  The JP drains were discontinued and\nprior to discharge, a right PICC line was placed and the CVL\nwas discontinued.\n\nThe patient had some difficulty with constipation but did\nmove his bowels the evening prior to discharge.  The patient\nwas tolerating a regular diet and adequate pain control on\np.o. pain medications.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Rehabilitation facility.\n\nDIET:  Cardiac and diabetic.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.

His blood pressure medications were initially held due\nto his sepsis, but these were resumed prior to discharge and\nwere tolerated well.\nHis Crestor was held, and will be held on discharge until PCP\nfollow up, considering his elevated LFT's from his biliary\nobstruction. Please follow up and resume when appropriate.\n.\n# Atrial Fibillation: Pt currently in afib, rate controlled.\nPt's metoprolol was resumed on [**10-25**], which he tolerated without\ndifficulty.

The patient was recently\ndischarged from [**Hospital1 2025**] 1 day prior to this admission for chest\npain.  The patient had a painful right antecubital IV site\nthat was warm and erythematous.  The patient stated that he\nhad acute onset of fever starting the afternoon prior to\nadmission and had \"\"delirium,\"\" and vomited 3 times.  He called\nEMS and was brought to [**Hospital6 256**].\nIn Emergency Room, he was found to have a temperature of 105,\na lactate of 5.9, and a sepsis protocol was initiated.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of\ninfiltrate.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE - 1) SEPSIS:  The patient was initially\nadmitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for sepsis as the\nsuspected source of the right antecubital fossa\nthrombophlebitis versus cellulitis.  He was treated with IV\nvancomycin and had a central line placed.  His quickly\ndefervesced.  He was seen by vascular surgery who felt that\nthere was no indication for urgent operation at this time,\nand he improved within 48 hours, and was transferred to the\nmedical floor.\n\n2) STERNAL WOUND DEHISCENCE:  The patient was seen by\ncardiothoracic surgery and plastic surgery for a sternotomy\ndehiscence after his coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\nHe was taken to the operating room on [**2148-4-5**] where\nhis sternum was repaired with a pectoralis muscle flap.\nPlease see the operative notes from Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and\n[**Name5 (PTitle) 70**].  The patient did well postoperatively without any\nsignificant complication.  However, he developed CHF and was\ntransferred to the cardiology service.\n\n3) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient has baseline of\nsystolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction\nof 30-35%.  After his sternal wound repair, he was developing\nworsening congestive heart failure secondary to\nintraoperative and perioperative IV hydration.  The patient\nalso developed a hyponatremia and was transferred to the\ncardiology service for diuresis.  He was started on\nnesiritide drip and made excellent progress with a negative\nfluid balance daily, and an improvement in his creatinine.\nHe was quickly changed over to oral lasix and was continued\non his qd ACE inhibitor and Toprol XL.  On the day of\ndischarge, the patient's CHF regimen was Toprol XL 200 mg qd,\nlisinopril 40 mg qd, and lasix 20 mg qd.  The patient will\nfollow-up with his cardiologist and will follow-up with his\nprimary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2 days of discharge to reassess\nhis volume status.\n\n4) CHEST PAIN:  The patient had postsurgical chest pain and\nwas initially treated with a PCA without any basal rate.\nAfter several days, the patient was changed over to oral\nnarcotics and was slowly weaned.  However, throughout the\nadmission the patient continued to complain of chest pain,\nwhile at the same time getting up, walking around the floor,\nand asking for additional narcotics and benzodiazepines.  The\npatient had multiple EKGs checked during his episodes of\nchest pain.  He never had any EKG changes consistent with\nischemia.  His vital signs remained stable during his\nepisodes of chest pain, and his episodes of chest pain were\nfelt to be solely due to musculoskeletal pain.\n\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the psychiatry\nservice and was instructed to follow-up with psychiatry.\nHowever, the patient has refused to follow-up with psychiatry\nin the past.  Even on the day of discharge, the patient\ncomplained of chest pain as he was being told that he was\nbeing discharged.  An EKG was checked at that time, and there\nwere no changes on his EKG compared to his baseline EKG from\n[**2148-3-22**].  His EKG only showed evidence of prior\ninferior ischemia and nonspecific, stable ST-T segment\nchanges.  The patient reports having had multiple admissions\nto multiple hospitals in the [**Location (un) 86**] area over the past\nseveral months, and has stated that he has spent very few\ndays not in a hospital.  By report, he has had these multiple\nadmissions for noncardiac chest pain.\n\n5) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient does, however, have\na long history of coronary artery disease and has had\ncoronary artery bypass graft surgery with a LIMA to LAD, and\nan SVG to PDA.  The patient did not have any active ischemia\nduring this admission, and was continued on his cardiac\nregimen consisting of aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, Toprol XL,\nand lisinopril.\n\n6) DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIOR:  During his admission, the patient\ncontinuous showed drug seeking behavior.  He would complain\nof chest pain that was so severe that he could not move.\nHowever, he did not receive any narcotics for his chest pain.\nHe would then get up out of bed and walk around the floor\nrequesting additional pain medication from nursing staff and\nhouse staff.  At this time, he would be walking around the\nfloor in no apparent distress, other than appearing angry\nbecause he could not receive any narcotics.  In addition,\nwhen discussing his discharge, the patient initially refused\ndischarge even when he was deemed medically stable for\ndischarge.  He felt that his pain would not be controlled as\nan outpatient and was demanding prescriptions for percocet,\nativan, Ambien, and morphine.  The patient was given the\ntelephone number and the name of the psychiatrist who saw him\nin consultation, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21722**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 47576**], and was\ninstructed to follow-up with him.  The patient was given a\nprescription for 2 week's worth of Ambien 10 mg tablets 1\ntablet po q hs, and he was given a prescription for 15\npercocet tablets prn 1-2 tablets q 8 h for pain.  He was\ninstructed to follow-up with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2\ndays, as scheduled, at 11:30 am on [**4-18**], to talk about\npain control.\n\n7) DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient is a type 2 diabetic and\nwas admitted on oral agents.  During this admission, the\npatient was maintained on glargine and Humalog insulin\nsliding scale with assistance from the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes\nspecialist.  However, the patient on discharge was unsure if\nhe would be able to do Humalog insulin sliding scale.  He\nideally would use glargine qd, and use a somewhat simplified\nsliding scale.  However, given his complicated medical\nregimen and his limited medical compliance, the patient was\ndischarged with instructions to follow-up with his primary\ncare physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 days to institute a simplified diabetes\nregimen that will control his blood sugars as much as\npossible, while also creating a regimen that he will be able\nto follow and comply with.\n\n8) HYPONATREMIA:  The patient was hyponatremic on admission\nand has a baseline sodium in the low to mid 130 range.  After\ndeveloping postoperative CHF, his sodium dropped to 126.  The\nsodium level responded to fluid restriction and diuresis, and\non the day of discharge the patient's sodium was 131.  The\npatient was discharged on his CHF regimen including lasix,\nand was instructed to maintain a fluid restriction of 1.5\nliters qd.\n\n9) JP DRAIN:  The patient's surgical wounds were followed by\nplastic surgery team while in-house.  On the day of\ndischarge, he had one remaining indwelling JP drain that was\ndraining approximately 180-250 cc/d.  He was instructed on\nhow to care for this drain, and how to empty it.  He will\nfollow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-23**] at 10:00 am for removal of\nthe drain and removal of the sutures.  He was given a\nprescription for po Keflex 500 mg po qid to take while he has\nthis JP drain in place.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To home with services.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

Non ST-segment myocardial infarction- The patient was\nadmitted CCU after ruling in for a NSTEMI. The etiology is\nunclear, but it occurred in the setting of SBP > 200.  Patient's\nnausea, vomiting, and throat pain were likely anginal\nequivalents. He was treated with aspirin, beta-blocker,\nIIb/IIIa, heparin and lipitor. Tight glucose control was\nobtained with an insulin drip.  Given patient's high risk TIMI\nscore, cardiology  suggested that patient proceed with\ncatherization. Given his  creatinine of 5.0, nephrology was\nconsulted. Nephrology concluded that there was a  significant\nrisk that the patient may require life-long dialysis if he\nproceeded with catheterization. The patient decided to defer the\ncatherization procedure to an outpatient procedure. Patient\nwanted time to discuss treatment options with his nephrologist,\nDr. [**Known firstname **].  The patient continued to be treated medically\nwith goal of normalizing blood pressures and glucose levels.\nAfter the patient was stablized on the medical floor, a\npharmacologic stress test was performed which showed no angina\nor EKG changes at peak exertion.  The perfusion scan was w/o\nfocal abnormalities but with the non-specific finding of\ndilation with stress (? 3 vessel disease).  Given that the\npatient was free of sx, he chose to defer catheterization.\n\n2. DM- On admission, patient was found to be in DKA. He was\nplaced on on an insulin drip, with resolution of anion gap\nmetabolic acidosis. The patient was followed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]\nDiabetes Center endocrinologist. He was transitioned to insulin\nsliding scale.  He was eventually restarted on his outpatient\ndose of NPH with the ISS. Blood sugars were high intermittently,\nbut urine remained neg for ketones and gap was normal. Glucose\ncontrol was well-controlled on discharged on NPH (16, 18). He\nwas advised to follow-up at the [**Hospital **] clinic as an outpatient.\n\n3. Hypertension- On admission, blood pressures were over 200.\nDuring the course of his hospitalization, Labetolol was\nincreased to 800 mg tid. Losartan 30 mg was added to blood\npressure regimen. Patient's PMD was consulted, and acknowledged\nthat pressures have also been difficult to treat as an\noutpatient. At time of discharge BP was 120/70 on Labetolol 800\ntid, hydralazine 50 qid and nifedipine 90. He was instructed to\nfollow up with his PMD.\n\n4. Renal Failure- Patient's renal failure was thought to be\npre-renal and a result of both, vomiting and dehydration. During\nhospitalization Cr decreased from 5.1 to 4.5.  He was also\ndischarged on epo injections.\n\n5. Peripheral Edema- patient was gently diuresed on last two\ndays of hospitalization.\nHe was discharged on Lasix 20 mg [**Hospital1 **].\n\n6. Addison's: He was maintained on fludrocortisone 0.1 and\nhydrocort 20 qAM, 5 qPM\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLabetalol 200 mg 3 tabs [**Hospital1 **].\nNifedipine XL 90 mg qd.\nHydralazine 50 mg qid.\n Procrit 5000 units injection weekly.\n Hydrocortisone 20 mg tablets 1 tablet am, tablet pm.\n Levothyroxine 50 mcg qd.\nMetolazone 2.5 mg qd.\n Lorazepam 0.5 mg prn\n Protonix 40 mg qd.\nFludrocortisone Acetate 0.1 mg 3 tabs qd.\nLasix 80 mg qd.\nAspirin 325 mg qd.\n Insulin- 16 q AM, 17 qPM\n Lipitor 10 mg qd.\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

She presented to\n[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital initially, after she began choking on\na dinner of Chinese food.  A day prior, she had had\nhematemesis, as well as some chest pain.  She was seen for an\ninitial evaluation at [**Location (un) **] where she was taken to the\nendoscopy suite.  An EGD revealed a 10 cm esophageal [**Location (un) 1994**]\nwith bleeding consistent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**], and\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation for concerns of\nesophageal perforation.\n\nOn arrival, a gastrografin bowel study was obtained that was\nnegative for perforation.

Likely, she has other esophageal\npathology such as peptic strictures from longstanding\ngastroesophageal reflux disease.  In her initial course, she\nwas treated supportively with blood transfusion to keep the\nhematocrit greater than 30%, given her underlying coronary\nartery disease.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction via\nserial enzymes.  She was treated with empiric antibiotics\nincluding ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Following\nblood product support, she remained hemodynamically stable\nwithout further evidence of bleed.\n\nGiven her hemodynamic stability, the consultation with the\ngastroenterology service, a repeat EGD was felt not to be of\nutility on this admission, due to the inability to dilate in\nthe setting of this [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**].  Rather, a diagnostic\nEGD after four to six weeks of esophageal rest, with proton\npump inhibitor prophylaxis, will allow for better\nvisualization, and perhaps tissue diagnosis.  While this is\nlikely a stricture, other processes cannot be ruled out, such\nas masses or carcinoma.\n\nHer hospital course was also notable for two days of\ndelirium.  This was in the setting of ativan.  Her mental\nstatus cleared with discontinuation of the benzodiazepine.\nShe had no further issues in this regard subsequently.\n\nWith respect to her hypertension, her antihypertensives were\nreinitiated upon achievement of hemodynamic stability.  Her\nblood pressure was well-controlled subsequently.\n\nWith respect to her diabetes, she is on a reduced dose of\ninsulin, as her PO tolerance steadily increases.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**].  2)\nGastroesophageal reflux disease.  3) Diabetes mellitus, type\n2.  4) Coronary artery disease.  5) Congestive heart failure.\n6) Hypertension.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  1) The patient will be discharged to\nextended care facility.  2) Her diet should consist of soft\nconsistency foods/diabetic foods for the next 6 weeks.  3)\nShe needs to be kept on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], for\nexample Protonix 40 mg po bid.  4) Her hematocrit should be\nmonitored on a qod basis to insure hemodynamic stability.  5)\nHer fingersticks should be monitored qid.  6) The patient is\ncurrently on 10 U of NPH in the am and 15 U of NPH in the pm.\nAs her PO tolerance increases, can titrate up to a home dose\nof Insulin:  25 U NPH, 5 U regular in am; 35 U NPH, 5 U\nregular in pm.  7) Refrain from giving patient nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatories or COXII inhibitors.

The patient was OB+.  She had a Hartmann in her\n40's and was found to be hypotensive.  She denies any chest\npain or shortness of breath.  Electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 11741**] depression in V2 and V4 and ST elevations in 2, 3, and AvF\nas well as complete heart block.  The patient was started on\nIV heparin and then became apneic and hypotensive in the\nemergency room. This required intubation and administration\nof dopamine.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac\ncatheterization, but has now become hypotensive on admission\nand still in complete heart block.  She had a left heart\ncatheterization which revealed 95% of left anterior\ndescending stenosis and 100% occluded left circumflex which\nwas stented.  She was also found to have a small RC not\nsupplying a large part of myocardium.  After this cardiac\ncatheterization, the patient has hypotension with an episode\nof supraventricular tachycardia.  All of these stopped with\nthe initiation of intra-aortic balloon pump.  In addition on\ndoing cardiac catheterization, the saturations in the left\nand right side of the heart suggested presence of\natrioventricular septal defect.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives alone.  No smoking\nor alcohol.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.7, heart rate of\n105, blood pressure was 126/50.  Respiratory rate is 20,\noxygen saturation is 98.  The patient is intubated and was\ngenerally nonreactive to stimuli.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and\nthroat: Pupils are small, but equal and reactive to light.\nMucus membranes are dry.  Neck:  Difficult to appreciate\njugular venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy is palpable.\nCardiovascular:  Tachycardic, obscured heart sounds.  Chest:\nGood breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft and nontender\nand normal active bowel sounds. Extremities:  No edema.  Good\nbilateral pulses.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Significant for CK of 159, MB of 15, index\nof 10 and troponin of 1.9.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1. Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary\nCare Unit for close observation monitoring. Immediately upon\nadmission, she had a TU which revealed anteroseptal defect.\nThe initial impression was to try to close this with a clam\nshell procedure which is going to offer her best chances of\nstabilizing a hemodynamics given that she became to be very\nhypotensive.\n\nHowever, discussion with the family, they decided that they\ndid not want any procedures done. The patient's blood\npressure remained extremely labile requiring a few pressors\nin the beginning with fair satisfactory result.  Initial\nsubsequent echocardiogram revealed that she had global left\nventricular hypokinesis.  She was started on aspirin, Plavix\nand maintained on IV heparin. She was also started on\nLipitor.  Initially, we could not start a beta-blocker given\nher complete heart block and hypotension.  However, this\nsubsequently improved.  This was added to her regimen.  To\nfurther improve her hemodynamics upon arrival to the CCU she\nreceived large amounts of fluid and became about 15 liters\npositive.  However, this increased preload and had\nsignificant improvement in her hemodynamics and initially was\ntolerated.  After while she became volume overloaded without\nevidence of compromising her oxygenation.  This volume\noverload was gradually improved with gentle diuresis and\nsometimes with autodiuresis.  Once the condition improved,\nshe was started on Captopril which she tolerated a small\ndose.  The balloon pump was stopped and had no significant\neffect on her hemodynamics.\n\nOn hospital day #4 and #5, it became apparent that the\npatient was aseptic which is the cause of her continued\nhypotension.  She required pressors for about 10 consecutive\ndays, but eventually was able to be weaned off completely and\nmaintained good blood pressure.  In terms of rhythm, the\npatient remained most of the time in first degree AV block\nand notable in complete heart block with tachycardia in the\nunit.  However, she did have one episode of atrial\nfibrillation in the context of ventilatory weaning.  Because\nof this, she was started on amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q. day.\nShe had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.  She is\nalso being anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation and for low\nejection fraction with akinetic ventricle.\n\n2. Infectious disease:  There were multiple consults\ninvolving infectious disease.  The patient was probably\naspirated during episodes of nausea and vomiting in the\noutside hospital and particularly given the findings on\nx-ray.  Sputum showed multiple organisms including gram\npositive cocci and gram negative rods, but none of these were\ngrown. She received a 14 day course of levofloxacin and\nFlagyl with marked improvement in her symptoms.\nAdditionally, the patient had 2 out of 4 blood cultures\npositive for staph.  Both local lines were stopped and she\nreceived a 14 day course of IV vancomycin.  Upon discharge,\nall of her infectious disease issues has been resolved and\nshe has no evidence of being infected at this point.\n\n3.  Renal:  Upon admission, the patient may be in very mild\nacidosis which could have an myocardial infarction. This\nimproved.  She was being diuresed while in the hospital\ncourse. She had a mild increase of creatinine and this is\nprobably normal and to be expected.\n\n4.  Endocrine:  The patient initially had very labile blood\nsugars in the 300 to 500 range.  She required initiation of\nIV insulin drip and this was continued for at least 4 days.\nThis patient was getting better and was changed to a standing\nNPH insulin.  It is quite likely that she has unrecognized\nunderlying diabetes mellitus that has not been treated. She\nwill probably require further follow up for this condition.\n\n5.  Pulmonary:  The patient was initially intubated for\nprotection.  She had a very prolonged and complicated course\nincluding inability to wean over a week, pneumonia and fluid\noverload.   On hospital day #10, the final attempts to\nextubate the patient was successful and she remained very\nstable from respiratory standpoint and positioned to room air\nshortly thereafter.  She has no acquired pneumonia and was\nable to breathe comfortably on room air at this point.\n\n6.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had some episodes of\nbleeding from the oropharyngeal tract, but this is believed\nmore to be due to injury from the TE and intubation rather\nthan any gastrointestinal bleed.   Consultation of ENT was\nobtained.  There is no continued gastrointestinal bleeding\nfrom the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Plavix 75 p.o. q. day indefinitely.\n2. Aspirin 325 p.o. indefinitely.\n3. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q. day to be switched to 200 mg\np.o. q. day in about 3 to 4 weeks.\n4. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day.\n5. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day, this may need to be readjusted\nfor proper INR.\n6. NPH 60 units in the morning, 10 units at night.\n7. Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Acute myocardial infarction.\n2. Status post catheterization.\n3. Diabetes mellitus.\n4. Atrial fibrillation.\n5. Sepsis.\n6.

On [**10-17**] he became\nhypotensive to SBP 70s-80s associated with an episode of coffee\nground emesis and guaiac positive stool and he was transferred\nto the MICU. He was given IVF and 1U PRBC and his\nanticoagulation was stopped. An upper endoscopy showed erosive\nesophagitis at the GE junction but no brisk bleeding. His Hct\nand blood pressure remained stable, and he was subsequently\ncalled out to the floor for further management. On the floor he\nwas monitored and anticoagulation was restarted. He remained\nstable with but began refusing medications and care, saying he\nwanted to die. On [**10-23**] a family meeting was held and it was\ndetermined that he would be taken home with VNA services for\ncare. On [**10-25**] he passed melena. His anticoagulation was held.\nHe was monitored overnight- his HCT and vitals were stable, and\nhe did not pass melena again, so given that his family was\nanxious to take [**Last Name (un) **] home, he was discharged with plan to follow\nup with his PCP the next day ([**2135-10-27**]) with his scheduled\nappointment.\n.\n# SEPSIS\nPatient met clinical criteria for sepsis in MICU, with fever,\nhypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate. Patient was\ngiven a 14 day course of Vanc/Zosyn to cover both pneumonia and\nsoft tissue infection, to which he responded well. Patient never\nrequired pressors.  A LLE MRI was negative for evidence of\nosteomyelitis (although the study was somewhat limited due to\nlack of gadolinium).  His blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] were never\npositive.  He also received 5 days of stress dose steroids for\nconcern of relative adrenal insufficiency.\n.\n# LE NECROTIC TOES\nPatient's exam was notable for non-dopplerable DP pulses and dry\ngangrene of toes on both feet.  He was evaluated by vascular\nsurgery with a CT of his aorta/iliac/femoral vessels and then by\na lower extremity angiogram.  There was no stentable lesion\nidentified on angiogram.  Cardiology consult assessed the\npatient to be high risk for a high risk procedure, and it was\ndecided not to pursue revascularization.  As he did not show\nevidence of having infection in his lower extremities, it was\ndecided to continue wound care of his feet rather than to\namputate at present.\n.\n# MOBILE ATHEROMA\nMobile atheroma of the descending aorta was noted on TEE done to\nevaluate sources of possible thromboemboli to necrotic toes.\nThe patient was started on a heparin gtt and then switched to\ncoumadin. Coumadin was held for GI bleed (see below) but\nrestarted once resolved. At the time of discharge the coumadin\nhas been held given 1 episode of melena [**10-25**] and INR 2.8, goal\nINR 2-2.5. Plan to f/u with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the day after\nd/c, to adjust anticoagulation accordingly.\n.\n# DELIRIUM\nDuring the patient's MICU admission, he had waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental\nstatus and at times became agitated.  His delirium was felt to\nbe multifactorial, including infection, ICU admission.  He\nreceived haldol with good effect.  By the time he was on the\nmedical floor, he remained alert and oriented, although there\nwere times when he would try to get out of bed despite his\nnecrotic toes.  Haldol was not needed.\n.\n# ESRD on PD\nPatient was followed by nephrology.  He received alternating\n1.5% and 2.5% dialysis baths to help with fluid removal after he\nwas discharged from the ICU. Renal team planned to discuss\ndialysis with his PCP/nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\n.\n# DEPRESSION\nPatient had reportedly tried Paxil for depression as an\noutpatient.  This was stopped when his wife clarified that the\npaxil had been making him drowsy and hence he had no longer been\ntaking it at home.\n.\n# DM\nAlthough the patient is on oral agents at home, he was given\ninsulin during his admission, especially since the 2.5% dialysis\nbath increased his insulin requirement.  He was switched back to\nhis home regimen lantus 6u qhs, but because of decreased po\nintake was changed to half dose, 3u qhs.\n.\n# CARDIAC\nA. CAD\nThe patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**], who reported that the patient\nhas had MI x 2 in the past, but is not aware of any PCI or CABG.\n Patient was put on aspirin and a low dose beta blocker as\ntolerated by his BP.  [**Name (NI) **] wife reported that the patient's\nstatin had been stopped by a doctor in the past; she was not\nsure why. On the floor the patient was started back on ASA 1\nweek after resolution of GIB (see below), and statin. BB was\nheld as his SBPs were ~100s. ASA was held [**10-25**] due to 1 episode\nof melena. It is recommended that the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 2 weeks after GIB\nbefore restarting ASA.\n.\nB. RHYTHM\nPatient was found to be in atrial fibrillation without rapid\nrhythm.  He was put on heparin drip and then switched to\ncoumadin.  He was also started on a beta blocker.\n.\nC. PUMP\nEcho demonstrated preserved EF, though the patient was felt to\nhave chronic diastolic heart failure.  Although he was volume\noverloaded after being treated for sepsis in the MICU, he\nremained euvolemic after the extra volume was removed by\ndialysis.\n.  .\n# Upper GI bleed: Did not appear brisk.\nGI performed EGD showing erosion of gastric esophageal junction.\nHe was transfused 1 unit pRBC, and hct responded appropriately\n23 - 26 and remained stable. Coumadin and ASA were held, but\nafter 1 week of remaining clinically stable were restarted. On\n[**10-25**] he had an episode of melena, coumadin and ASA were held.\nHe was monitored overnight, his HCT the next day remained stable\naround 26, he was hemodynamically stable and his family was\ninsistent that he leave, so he was discharged home with plan to\nf/u with PCP the next day.\n.\n# lung nodule and duodenal polyps - were observed on CT (see\nreport), recommended for PCP to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u as outpatient.\n.\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition [**2135-10-26**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHectorol 5mcg qMTWThF\nKDur 20mEq PO tid\nLactulose 1 tbsp PO daily prn\nNephrocaps 1 PO daily\nNexium 20mg PO daily\nPrandin 2mg qAM / 1mg qPM\nRenagel 800mg PO tid\nSenna 2 tabs PO qhs\nSensipar 30mg PO daily alternating with 60mg daily\nCompazine one tablet po PRN\nColace 1 tsp po daily prn\nAtarax 1 tablet po bid prn itch\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He had been actively\nusing IV drugs (shooting crushed oxycontin and cocaine) prior to\nadmission and drinking 2 liters of EtOH daily. CT abd showed\nseptic embolic and TTE; subsequent TEE showed mitral valve\nvegetation and leukocytosis.  He was started on vancomycin and\nzosyn at OSH; here, he was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone\nwith gentamicin for synergy.  On presentation, CT did show\nevidence of septic emboli to the abdomen and brain. Blood\ncultures at OSH were positive for Strep salivarius; blood\ncultures here on [**9-18**] were positive for staph epi, thought to be\na contaminant. His course was complicated by finding of large\nintraparenchymal brain hemorrhage on MRI attributed to his\nendocarditis. He was started on LeVETiracetam 1000 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]\nfor seizure prophylaxis. Picc line was placed for long term IV\nantibiotic administration.  Gentamicin was administered for\ntotal of 14 days.  Vancomycin (day #1 [**9-12**]) should continue for\na total of 6 weeks, last dose on [**2111-10-24**].  Patient has followup\nset up with Infectious Disease team after discharge.\n\nPatient will require outpatient evaluation by Cardiothoracic\nSurgery to evaluate for mitral valve repair after finishing his\ncourse of antibiotics.  He should follow up in Cardiology clinic\nafter the CT Surgery evaluation.\n\n# Cerebral hemorrhage:\nOn presentation, neurological exam was normal, though head CT\nshowed 8 mm right frontal white matter hypodensity, nonspecific,\nand\nwithout mass effect.  Follow up study using head MRI showed\nlarge brain hemorrhage in region of R PCA territory with a L\nparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Neurosurgery and neurology\nwere consulted and pt was started on Keppra for seizure\nprophylaxis. Follow up studies suggested midline shift in the\nevolving R PCA lesion and he was started on mannitol briefly.\nPatient was followed with serial neuro exams on the ventilator\nhowever after extubation he continued to be unable to move right\nside of body.  Has been informed of this, but patient unable to\nremember or process this information completely at this time. He\nwas kept on fall precautions and low boy bed. Cerebral angiogram\non Monday [**9-22**] showed mycotic aneurysm in the left middle\ncerebral artery; the aneurysm was embolized with some sacrifice\nof a small distal branch of the left MCA. Patient had some mild\ncerebral edema post procedure and was monitored for two nights\nin the Neuro ICU, then transferred to the floor. On the floor,\nhe showed some mild improvement in being able to just slightly\nmove his right hand and foot.  Of note, patient does appear to\nshow some signs of frontal lobe dysfunction, including\nimpulsivity. Patient was seen by physical and occupational\ntherapy.  He will require extensive post-stroke physical therapy\nto attempt to regain as much function as possible of his right\nupper and lower extremities.\n\nPatient will need CT-A of head and follow up with Neurosurgery\nteam in 1 month as outpatient, already scheduled.\n\n# Respiratory Status:\nHe was intubated for respiratory distress likely [**2-24**] to alcohol\nwithdrawal. He was extubated [**9-18**] w/o complication and kept on\noxygen via NC. Oxygen was weaned as tolerated.\n\n# Alcohol Withdrawal:\nPatient describes very difficult prior detox attempts. He\nadmitted to drinking >2 liters of alcohol during his recent\nsubstance abuse binges. Intubated in CCU for respiratory\ndistress. Valium per CIWA scale was unable to alleviate his\ndiaphoresis, anxiety, and tachypnea. He was started on thiamine\nand MVI and midazolam sedation while intubated. Post-extubation\nhe was continued on lorazepam 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA>10 for a\nfew days.  CIWA scale was discontinued upon transfer to floor,\nas patient no longer showed any signs of withdrawal.\n\n# Abdominal pain:\nPt complained of abdominal pain early during hospitalization,\nlikely secondary to septic emboli to kidney, liver, and spleen.\nAbdominal pain self-resolved. Patient was treated for\nendocarditis to prevent further septic emboli.\n\n# [**Month/Year (2) **] abuse:\nPatient has recent history of IV drug abuse with injection of\ncocaine and oxycontin. Social work was consulted to follow along\nwith patient. Withdrawal symptoms managed as stated above.\nPatient was kept on nicotine patch.\n\n#  Hepatitis C:\nPatient was diagnosed with HCV 6 years ago, unclear if he had\nstarted any treatment. ALT, AST, and total bili were not\nelevated with normal INR. No stigmata of chronic liver disease\nwere noted on exam. Recommend follow up with hepatologist as\noutpatient.\n.\n#  Agitation:\nPt had several episodes of agitation and delerium at night time.\nPt was otherwise calm during the day. Agitation was felt to\nlikely be a sundowning effect or possible residual withdrawal\nsymptoms. On several occasions pt attempted to stand up and walk\nwhich resulted in him falling out of bed given his limited\nmobility. Pt did not injure himself or hit his head but there\nwas concern regarding his agitation leading to possible injury.\nVeil bed and low bed were tried; veil bed made the pt more\nagitated and angry while the low bed did not fully keep pt\nwithin the bed but prevented falls from any height. Zyprexa was\ntried as an alternative but there was some concern about whether\nthis contributed to further agitation on one occasion. Pt was\ngiven low dose of ativan in the evenings with good effect,\nallowing him to sleep through all or most of the night without\nincident.\n\n#Discharge:\nPt was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] in stable condition for\nfurther rehabilitation care during his recover and completion of\nIV antibiotics.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nTylenol - up to 4 tabs [**Hospital1 **]\nMVI\nIbuprofen ? amount\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You were admitted\nto the hospital with symptoms of fever, abdominal pain,\nshortness of breath and low energy. You were found to have an\ninfection in your heart on your mitral valve called endocarditis\nlikely secondary to your IV drug use. You were started on IV\nantibiotics to treat this infection.\n\nWhile you were hospitalized, your breathing became more labored\nand you had difficulty protecting your airway in the setting of\nwithdrawal from the recent drugs and alcohol you had been using.\nYou were intubated and kept on a ventilator to help you breath.\nYou were extubated after a few days on the ventilator without\ncomplication.\n\nYou also had a stroke that was attributed to your heart\ninfection. It was a bleed detected which is the reason for your\nright sided arm and leg weakness. You were transferred to the\ngeneral floor after being stabilized in the ICU. You were\ncontinued on IV antibiotics for the infection. Neurology\nfollowed your case in the hospital to make recommendations\nregarding your stroke.  You were also seen by the Neurosurgery\nteam who embolized the aneurysm they found in the left side of\nyour brain so that it would not bleed again.\n\nThe following changes have been made to your medications:\n\n1. Started Ceftriaxone to treat the infection in your heart\nvalve\n2. Take folic acid, thaimine and a multivitamin to treat\nnutritional deficiencies.\n3. Take nicotine patch to treat your nicotine addiction.\n4. Take Levetiracetam to prevent a seizure after your stroke.\n5. Take cortisone or Sarna lotion as needed for your rash\n6. Take colace and senna if you get constipated\n7. Take Tylenol for pain\n8. Take Ativan 1-2mg at midnight to help you sleep or for\nanxiety\n9. Take Heparin injections to prevent more blood clots\n10. Stop taking Ibuprofen\n\nPlease follow up with your doctors at the [**Name5 (PTitle) 4314**] below.\n\nIt is important that you follow up with the Neurosurgery team\nand get a repeat CT-Angiogram of your head in 1 month.\n\nYou will also follow up with the infectious disease doctors.\n\nAfter finishing all of your antibiotics, you will need to see\nthe Cardiothoracic Surgeons in clinic so that they can decide\nwhether or not you would benefit from surgery to fix your heart\nvalve that has been damaged from your infection.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: INFECTIOUS DISEASE\nWhen: FRIDAY [**2111-10-16**] at 11:00 AM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 27625**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**]\nBuilding: LM [**Hospital Ward Name **] Bldg ([**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) [**Hospital 1422**]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage\n.\nDepartment: RADIOLOGY\nWhen: THURSDAY [**2111-11-5**] at 1:30 PM\nWith: CAT SCAN [**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**]\nBuilding: CC CLINICAL CENTER [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Street Address(1) 592**] Garage\n\nDepartment: NEUROSURGERY\nWhen: THURSDAY [**2111-11-5**] at 2:15 PM\nWith: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7746**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3666**]\nBuilding: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage\n\nDepartment: CARDIAC SURGERY\nWhen: THURSDAY [**2111-10-29**] at 2:00 PM\nWith: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) 6144**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**]\nBuilding: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Location (un) 551**]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage\n\nDepartment: CARDIAC SERVICES\nWhen: THURSDAY [**2111-11-12**] at 2:40 PM\nWith: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**]\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\n\n\n\"\n31072,84450,112186,2168-02-08,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2168-1-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-2-8**]\n\nDate of Birth:  [**2108-6-28**]             Sex:   F\n\nService: MEDICINE\n\nAllergies:\nHeparin Agents\n\nAttending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]\nChief Complaint:\nMechanical fall at nursing home on [**2168-1-30**], transferred from OSH\nto [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopedic hemiarthroplasty of displaced left\nfemoral neck fracture, acute on chronic subdural hematoma\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\nLeft hemiarthroplasty\nIVC filter placement\nLeft IJ central venous line placement\nHemodialysis\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\n59 [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] nursing home resident with ESRD/HD, seizure\ndisorder, CVA w/ left-sided weakness, recent MRSA endocarditis\ns/p 6 week course of Vancomycin, SLE, Atrial Fibrillation and\nantiphospholipid syndrome on coumadin.

Patient is s/p left hip hemiarthoplasty and IVC\nfilter placement. During this hospitalization, had two seizures\novernight on POD#1, was transferred to the ICU and also found to\nhave HIT+ antibody.\n.\n#. HYPERCOAGULABLE STATE vs. BLEEDING RISK: Very complicated\nrisk-benefit analysis in terms of restarting anticogaulation in\npatient. She has been on long-term anticoagulation with Coumadin\nwhich had to be reversed in the setting of her acute on chronic\nsubdural hematoma and left hip fracture. Reasons to start\nanticoagulation: HIT +, new right basilic vein DVT, AFib, recent\nendocarditis, antiphospholipid syndrome in setting of SLE,\nmultiple CVAs with therapeutic INR, recent ortho trauma with\nrelative immobilization.  [**Name2 (NI) 73367**] to not anticoagulate: s/p\nacute on chronic SDH after a fall on [**2167-1-31**], IVC filter.\nNeurosurgery preferred that patient not be anticoagulated but\nfelt that if absolutely necessary, patient should be\nanticoagulated with a lower PTT goal of 40-60. In the setting of\nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia, Hematology recommended\nanticoagulation with Argatroban. The Primary Geriatric team and\npatient's primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] also favored\nanticoagulation. Patient was started on Argatroban gtt and was\nintially supratherapeutic in the high 60s-70s. Ultimately,\npatient's PTT was therapeutic at ~60 mcg/kg/minute. Patient had\nneurological checks every 4 hours without concerns for rebleed\ninto her SDH in setting of resumed anticoagulation. Hematology\ncontact[**Name (NI) **] patient's previous rheumatologist at [**Hospital1 **] who confirmed patient has antiphospholipid,\nanticardiolipin antibodies since [**2147**], lupus anticoagulant in\n[**2152**]. Of note, Neurology had wished to start antiplatelet\ntherapy on patient, as well, given her coagulopathies but given\npatient's low platelet counts during this admission and the fact\nthat she was not on Coumadin during this admission, they held\noff. This will need to be discussed at her outpatient Neurology\nappointment.\n- Continue Argatroban gtt at rate of 0.171 mcg/kg/min given PTT\nof 45.1 (decreasing) on day of discharge. Patient will get PTT\nchecks at hemodialysis three times weekly. Please titrate\nArgatroban infusion rate accordingly, for goal PTT of 40-60.\nWhen changing rate, should increase/decrease by\n0.125-0.25mcg/kg/min.\n- Start Coumadin once platelets >100 with 5 days of overlap with\nArgatroban\n- Please have patient follow-up in [**Hospital 878**] Clinic with Drs.\n[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 73368**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**].

Hematology contact[**Name (NI) **] patient's outpatient\nnephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15172**], who confirmed patient has known HIT\nantibody positive history. She had initially been diagnosed at\n[**Hospital 794**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 789**], RI and had been evaluated by\nhematology there. Once care was transferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15172**],\npatient has been receiving altepase instead of heparin during\noutpatient hemodialysis sessions. Hematology reviewed patient's\nperipheral smear and felt that microangiopathic hemolytic anemia\nis unlikely. They felt that the recent decline in platelet count\ncould be attributed to appropriate consumption, given recent\nhemorrhage and clotting. Drug effect was also considered\nalthough which medication causing it could not be pin-pointed.\nKeppra has not been known to cause thrombocytopenia, nor\nArgatroban. Lamictal is reported to cause thrombocytopenia but\npatient has been on that medication long-term. Hematology\nrecommended platelet goal >50 with plans to start Prednisone\n1mg/kg daily for ?autoimmune thrombocytopenia (in association\nwith APLAS) should platelet count continue to drop. Patient's\nplatelet count was relatively stable at 65 on day of discharge\n- Continue to avoid heparin in patient; altepase can be used as\nan alternative for flushes\n- Please resume Coumadin once patient's platelet count is above\n100. She will need 5 days overlap of Coumadin with Argatroban\n- Please follow-up in [**Hospital **] Clinic. You have an appointment\nto see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3065**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4762**] on [**2-19**] at 10:30am. You can\nreach his office at: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**]\n.\n#. SEIZURE DISORDER: Has prior seizure disorder and acute on\nchronic subdural hematoma. Neurology monitored patient for 24\nhours with EEG and she was not having status epilepticus.\nImmediately after her two seizures, patient was noted to have\naltered mental status which gradually resolved. By day of\ndischarge, patient was alert and oriented X3.\n- Continue Lamictal 50mg twice daily with uptitration as\nfollows:\nWeek [**1-30**] 50mg  [**Hospital1 **]\nWeek [**3-31**] 50/75mg\nWeek [**6-2**] 75mg [**Hospital1 **]\nWeek [**8-4**] 75/100mg\nWeek [**10-7**] 100mg [**Hospital1 **]\nWeek [**12-9**] 100/125mg\nWeek 13-14 125mg [**Hospital1 **]\n- Continue Keppra 750mg daily, dosed AFTER hemodialysis on HD\ndays\n- Please have patient follow-up in [**Hospital 878**] Clinic with Drs.\n[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 73368**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**].

Neurosurgery felt no\nsurgical intervention was needed. Of note, patient did sustain\nanother unwitnessed fall the day prior to discharge. CT head was\nnegative for any new hemorrhage and the old acute on chronic\nsubdural hematoma was stable. Patient demonstrated no acute\nmental status changes concerning for worsening of her subdural\nhematoma.\n- Patient will need follow-up head CT once anticoagulation is\ntherapeutic\n- Patient will need head CT if mental status changes (for\npossible bleeding into subdural hematoma)\n.\n#. HYPERTENSION: It was difficult to obtain consistent blood\npressure measurements on patient given her left AV fistula and\ndifficulties measuring in right arm. Per neurosurgery, goal was\nfor patient's mean arterial pressures to be <110 to manage her\nsubdural hematoma and subsequent bleeding risk. Patient was\ncontinued on home nifedipine 30mg daily and home metoprolol; the\nlatter was increased from 75mg to 125mg twice daily to maintain\nMAP <110.\n- Continue Metoprolol 125mg twice daily\n- DISCONTINUE Nifedipine 30mg daily\n- START Lisinopril 5mg daily\n.\n#. RECENT ENDOCARDITIS: Patient completed 6 week course of\nVancomycin in mid-[**Month (only) **] for MRSA endocarditis. Repeat ECHO\n(TTE) during this admission confirmed residual thickening and\nfibrous quality to mitral valve that can make patient at\nincreased risk for future embolic events.\n.\n#.

ANEMIA: Unclear baseline but stable during this\nhospitalization\n- Consider Epo at outpatient dialysis\n.\n#. THYROID NODULE: Incidentally noted on admission CT spine.\n- Patient will need outpatient follow-up with her primary care\nprovider\n.\n#. NUTRITION: Speech and Swallow evaluated patient and felt she\nwas appropriate for diet as follows - PO diet of soft solids,\npills crushed in applesauce, one-on-one supervision, every 4\nhours oral care.\n.\n#. ACCESS: Patient has right IJ placed [**2167-2-3**]; right tunneled HD\ncath. Patient's left IJ entral venous line stopped drawing back\nblood and could not be flushed. Patient has left AV graft and\nright upper extremity DVT, making PICC lines in either arm\nimpossible.

He states\nthat he first noticed that something was wrong a couple of weeks\nago, after eating eating ice cream and drinking ice water at\nnight.  Later that night, after going to bed and falling asleep,\nhe was woken with a strange feeling which he describes as a\ncurtain descending down over his abdomen.  He states it felt as\nif his body, in the region of his abdomen, had just shut down.\nHe fell back asleep the night, hoping that the strange feeling\nwould go away on its own.  Over the next few days, he began to\nnotice a pain in his upper back.  He describes that pain as\nsimilar to a muscle spasm, in his back, that does not radiate.\nWhen the pain first began, it was intermittent and could be\nbrought on by nearly anything, including getting up to walk and\neating.  He tried Advil and acetominophen which helped at first\nto relieve his pain.  He noticed that his pain gradually became\nmore intense, and more intolerable.  He reports occasional chest\npain, shortness of breath, and feeling feverish when his pain\nwould become severe. At the time of presentation to an OSH, his\npain was constant, not relieved with Advil or acetominophen, and\nhe reports it as a [**9-26**].  He also developed a dry,\nnon-productive cough over the past 2-3 days, and a feeling of\nnausea that developed when he would cough.  At times, when the\npain would become severe, he began to feel feverish and\ndeveloped sweats.  He reports that his last bowel movement was\nnearly a week ago.  Patient reports that he was in Tripoli,\nNorth [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s during the Korean war.  Recalls one\nepisode of walking pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not\nhospitalized.  Recalls no episodes of hemoptysis.  He estimates\nthat he has lost ~10 pounds over the past two months due to\ndecreased appetite and pain with eating.  He denies chills,\nnight sweats, changes in vision, headache, shortness of breath,\nchest pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, numbness,\nparasthesias.\n\nPast Medical History:\n## Hypertension- not on medication\n## Cataracts- repaired in right eye\n## MI- history of MI in '[**83**] and '[**86**], with balloon angioplasty in\n'[**86**]\n## History of coccygeal fracture ~20 years ago\n\nSocial History:\nDivorced.

There is involvement of the disc, and there is an\nepidural mass.  The features in general suggest that this may be\na malignant process rather than an active infection, although\ngranulomatous disease would be an additional consideration.  The\nfindings are a bit unusual for bacterial abscess, but this is\nnot entirely excluded.\n.\nMRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE:\nIMPRESSION:  First degree spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.  Mild disc\nbulging.  No evidence of focal disc protrusion.  No evidence of\na destructive mass or abscess in the lumbar region.\n.\nCT T-spine w/o contrast [**2100-11-30**]:\nAgain seen is destruction of the inferior one-half of T7 and\nsuperior endplate of T8 with a large associated paraspinal mass.\n There is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion of\nbone fragments into the\nventral part of the spinal canal.  The degree of cord\ncompression is better evaluated on the previous day's MRI.\nAgain noted is kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at this\nlocale.  No new abnormalities are identified. There are\nemphysematous changes in the lungs.  Aortic calcifications are\nidentified.\n.\nCT abdomen/pelvis [**2100-12-2**]:\nCT ABDOMEN:  The gallbladder is distended likely due to fasting.\n However,\nclinical correlation is recommended.  The liver, spleen, and\npancreas are\nunremarkable.  The small 11-mm left adrenal gland nodule is not\nwell\ncharacterized in this study.  The right adrenal gland is normal.\n Small\nhypodense area at the interpolar region of the right kidney is\ntoo small to be characterized.  Small and large bowel are\ngrossly unremarkable.  There is a moderate amount of stool\nwithin the colon.  The appendix is within normal limits.  Severe\ncalcifications of the aorta.  All the major branches are patent.\n No free fluid or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.\nCT PELVIS:  Urinary bladder, distal ureters are unremarkable.\nNo free fluid or free air in the pelvis.  Calcifications within\nthe prostate. Small segment of chronic dissection involving both\nproximal common ilia\narteries.\n.\nTTE [**2100-12-6**]:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are\nnormal. LVEF=55%.  The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated\nwith focal near akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral\nwall. The remaining segments contract well. Transmitral Doppler\nand tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild)\nLV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular cavity size and free\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly\nthickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. No systolic prolapse is seen. No mass or vegetation\nis seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is\nseen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top\nnormal. There is no pericardial effusion.\n.\nCXR PA/Lateral [**2100-12-6**]:\nIMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural\neffusions but no evidence for CHF. Small well defined nodular\ndensity right lung base. Correlate with prior outside films if\navailable . Further evaluation, either by follow up plain\nradiographs in approx 3 months or by CT is suggested.\n.\nChest CT [**2100-12-7**]:\nThe multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are subcentimeter ranging\nup to 9 mm in the right paratracheal, 8 mm in the outer\npulmonary, and 1 cm in subcarinal are.  There is no hilar or\naxillary lymphadenopathy.  The aorta is calcified with\nrelatively thick mural plaques ranging up to 4 mm, some of them\nulcerated, for example in the proximal distending thoracic\naorta, series 2, image 26, 27; at the level of the aortic arch,\nseries 2, image 21; in the distending aorta, series 2, image 31.\n The extensive mural thickening also involve the origin of the\nleft subclavian and left carotid and innominate arteries.\nThe assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrate mild\ncentrilobular emphysema involving predominantly the upper lobes.\n A focal thickening of the left fissure is 4.3 mm in length.\nThe bilateral pleural effusion is small with adjacent lung\natelectasis.  Additional area of focal pleural thickening is in\nthe right upper lobe, series 4, image 45.  No other lung nodules\nor masses are identified.  The images of the upper abdomen\ndemonstrate normal liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas and\nkidneys.  The gallbladder is markedly distended measuring up to\n6 cm in diameter with some high-attenuation of the posterior\nportion suggesting vicarious excretion.\n.\n[**2100-12-17**] U/S:  IMPRESSION: Negative bilateral lower extremity DVT\nstudy.\n.\n[**2100-12-27**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Increase in size of left pleural\neffusion and new relatively large area of consolidation in\nlingula and left lower lobe since prior study of [**2100-12-24**].\n\n.\n[**2100-12-30**] CT CHEST:  IMPRESSION:\n1. Decrease in size of a moderate left pleural effusion with\nloculated components. High attenuation within a loculated fluid\ncollection in the left upper hemithorax suggests component of\npossible hemothorax and is unchanged. No evidence of new or\nactive extravasation.\n2. Ground-glass opacity at the left base consistent with\nreexpansion edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis.\nBibasilar hydrostatic interstitial edema.\n3.

He\nsubsequently was found to have a MSSA osteomyelolitis, underwent\ncolpectomy and fusion, however his course was complicated by\npost-op NSTEMI, bradycardic arrest (complete heart block), upper\nextremity venous clot, and delerium.\n.\n## Epidural Mass:\nPatient presented with back pain of increasing severity of 2\nweeks duration, that he rated as [**9-26**] on admission. Patient had\ndecreased patellar reflexes but no other focal neurological\ndeficits, and back was non-tender to palpation. No leg weakness,\nsensory deficits or bowel/bladder incontinence.  MRI on\nadmission showed an epidural mass at T7-T8 level with some\nmoderate cord compression.  CT spine confirmed this finding.\nFound to have elevated ESR to 102 and CRP of 216 concerning for\ninfectious process. Based on imaging the differential of the\nepidural mass was infection (bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma),\nvs malignancy vs AV malformation. The patient denied any history\nor exposure to TB, however he was in North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s\nduring the Korean war. Recalled one episode of walking\npneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not hospitalized. Recalls no\nepisodes of hemoptysis. The patient denied any history of\nmalignancy, however he has not seen a physician in many years.\nGiven the possibility of infection he was started on\nbroad-spectrum abx including Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and flagyl\nIV.  He was afebrile.  Ortho spine followed the patient and he\nwas provided with a TLSO brace given his T7 collapse.  Serial\nneurological exams were performed looking for signs of cord\ncompression and were normal.  On [**12-3**] the patient underwent\nCT-guided biopsy of the mass and tissue was sent to microbiology\n and pathology.  Gram stain and culture returned positive for\nGPC.  ID was consulted for further recommendations.  When\norganisms were identified as Staph aureus the ceftriaxone and\nflagyl were discontinued.  He was continued on vancomycin with\ngoal troughs 17-20.  When sensitivities returned MSSA the\nvancomycin was switched to Nafcillin 2gm IV q4h.\n.\nID recommended TTE given epidural abscess and murmur on exam\n(unclear age given no regular medical care).  TTE showed no\nevidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses.  A\nTEE was not performed given the patient would require a long\ncourse of antibiotics and TEE would not change the management.\nA PPD was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differential\nand was negative.  Additionally, AFB smear and stain were both\nnegative.  AFB culture is pending.  There was no evidence of\ngranulomas on CXR or chest CT suggestive of old TB infection.\n.\nAlthough the patient appeared to have an MSSA abscess, an\nunderlying process could not be excluded.  Given possibility for\nunderlying malignancy an SPEP/UPEP were sent. PSA was 1.0 and\nchest CT showed no lung nodules. Path of epidural biopsy showed\ninflammation. Given the location of the abscess and involvement\nof T7-T8 vertebrae with T7 collapse, the patient was taken to\nthe OR for surgical spine debridement/stabilization by ortho\nspine. He underwent two surgical procedures to debride and\nstabilize his spine (please see op notes from [**12-10**] and [**12-13**]\nfor details).  He should complete a 6 week course of nafcillin\nto end on [**2101-1-20**].  He has follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on\n[**2101-1-5**] and may need lifelong suppressive therapy.\n.\n## NTEMI - Two days after his second surgery, the patient\ndeveloped chest pain.  An EKG revealed lateral ST depressions.\nThe pain was relieved by nitroglycerine complicated by mild\nhypotension.  His cardiac enzymes were positive with a troponin\nT peak of 0.27. His CPK-MB was also mildly elevated to 12.  He\nwas conservatively managed particularly with regard to his\nrecent spine surgery.  His cardiac regimen was adjusted to\ninclude aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and Imdur.\n.\n## Cardiac arrest - The patient's course was further complicated\nby a bradycardic arrest leading to asystole.  This episode was\nnot captured on telemetry. He received CPR as his DNR status had\ntemporarily been changed peri-operative.  He was resuscitated\nsuccessfully without use of epinephrine, atropine, or\nelectricity.  He was initially stabilized after transfer to the\nCCU but had a similar arrest twice the next morning each\nfollowing repositioning. Telemetry revealed complete heartblock.\n An externalized pacemaker was placed with a screw-in lead in\nthe RV as putting a permanent pacer in while the osteomyelitis\nwas being treated.  The bradycardia appears to have been\ntriggered by excessive vagal tone.  The day before discharge a\nperm. pacemaker was placed and was interrogated by EP and found\nto be working well.  He has follow up on [**2101-1-5**] with the\ndevice clinic to further evaluate the pacer.\n.\n## Anemia: Patient was found to be anemic on admission.  No\nbaseline for comparison.  Fe studies suggestive of anemia of\nchronic disease.  Patient reports no hemoptysis,\nhematemesis,melena, or hematochezia. EBL from the surgery was\n~500cc.  Late into his CCU stay, he developed guaiac positive\nstool.  His Hct stabilized after transfusion.  He continued on a\nPPI.  He can follow-up with his PCP for potential referral to GI\nfor colonoscopy as an outpatient.\n.\n## Delirium: The patient developed delirium attributed to\nmedications (narcotics and benzodiazepines), and disruption in\nsleep-wake cycle and CCU psychosis.  He was found not to have\ncapacity to refuse life saving interventions.  His daughter\n[**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was appointed health care proxy.  The patient's\nagitation was managed with nightly haldol with as needed haldol\nas well.  Other sedating medications such as narcotics and\nbenzodiazepines should be avoided as much as possible. Once he\nwas transferred to the regular medical floor his delirium\nimproved and by discharge he no longer displayed any signs of\ndelirium.\n.\n## Constipation/diarrhea:  Patient had not had a bowel movement\nin over a week when he presented.  He was started on an\naggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement of\nlarge amount of narcotics.  This bowel regimen was weaned down\nover the course of his hospital stay.  Since being on the\nantibiotics, he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube in\nplace. The diarrhea could be from an infectious source vs. the\nantibiotics themselves.  He was tested for C diff and found to\nbe negative x3.  A C diff B toxin has been sent and will be\nfollowed up after discharge.\n.\n## Hypertension:  Patient has a history of hypertension but had\nnever been treated. BP was initially labile and elevated\nreadings seemed to correlate with pain.  When pain was better\ncontrolled the patient's BP remained elevated with SBP 140-150\nat times.  His blood pressure was controlled as above.\n.\n## Iliac artery dissections: Incidental finding on CT. Vascular\nconsult obtained. No evidence of peripheral vascular compromise.\n Vascular team recommended outpatient follow up in 6 months with\nultrasound.\n.\n## Upper Extremitiy DVT - The patient developed a clot in the\nright cephalic vein in the setting of a RIJ central venous\ncatheter.  He was initially anticoagulated but this was held in\nthe setting of the GIB.  Warm compresses and arm elevation\nshould be used to limit propagation of the clot.  The patient\nhad a CTA of the chest that was negative for PE.\n.\n## Enterobacter in sputum - The patient did have a sputum\nculture that revealed a pan-sensitive enterobacter cloacae.  He\ndid not have any clinical evidence of pneumonia (no fever,\nnormalizing WBC, no definitive consolidation on imaging).\nAntibiotics, levofloxicin, directed at this bacteria were\nstarted when he was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR and some\nshortness of breath. He also developed a large pleural effusion\nand underwent a thorocentesis.  The fluid was exudative and\nlikely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain was\nnegative (he has been on antibiotics).  The cytology is still\npending and should be followed up by his PCP.\n.\n## Elevated Creatinine - Creatinine was 1.6 on admission.\ncorrected following IVF.\n.\n## Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin converted to [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings and\npneumo-boots with slow GIB.\n.\n## FEN -Regular diet with 5x/day nutritional supplements with\nensure plus. Did have hypokalemia likely secondary to\nmedications and loose stools.  He will receive standing\npotassium repletion and need potassium level checked shortly\nafter discharge to adjust the dose.\n.\n## CODE - DNR/DNI. patient's daughter [**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was\nappointed health care proxy during this admission.\n.\n## Dispo - discharged to rehab\n.\n.\nFollow up:\nC diff B toxin\npotassium on [**2101-1-4**]\nWeekly LFTs, CBC, Cr on Mondays to be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11382**] in ID\ncytology from pleural fluid\nB12 levels\nout-patient colonoscopy\nUltrasound of bilateral lower extremities in 6 months for\nevaluation of iliac artery dissections\n\nMedications on Admission:\nTylenol prn\nAdvil prn\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The right ventricle is not well seen but may\nwell be dilated and hypokinetic. There is asymmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy without evidence of outflow tract\ngradient.\n\n[**2127-2-13**] CXR - New bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration\ngiving its relatively rapid appearance.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with dementia, AFib, HTN admitted with\nSDH s/p fall.\n\nNEURO: Mr. [**Known lastname 76261**] was admitted to the ICU on [**2127-2-6**] with a left\nparietal/occipital SDH. He did well neurologically while he was\nin the ICU. The patient does have baseline dementia, but was\nmoving all 4 extremities and was partially oriented. He had a CT\nscan on [**2127-2-8**] which showed that the SDH was stable and he was\ntransferred to the neuro step-down unit that day. He was placed\non dilantin for seizure prophylaxis for a total of 10 days (last\nday [**2127-2-16**]).  The patient continued to do well neurologically\nand was transferred to the floor on [**2127-2-9**]. The ortho-spine\nteam recommended that the patient wear a soft collar and he will\nfollow-up with them in 2 weeks with dynamic C-spine xrays.  The\npatient was neurosurgically stable and did not need any surgical\nintervention and it was decided that the patient should be\ntransferred to the geriatrics service for further care.   Prior\nto his acute decompensation, he was instructed to follow-up with\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  His respiratory status then worsened, prompting his\nfamily to seek comfort measures only.  He expired [**2127-2-16**].\n\nRESP: On [**2127-2-10**] the patient had a video swallow evaluation,\nshowing that he was aspirating 50% with an agreed upon resultant\nplan for PEG.  Pt's mental status improved over 48hrs with a\nrepeat video swallow [**2127-2-13**] showing minimal aspiration and a\ndiet for honey thick liquids and pureed solids was recommended\nwith supplemental IV fluid.  The family then decided that they\nwould not want a PEG tube placed.  On [**2127-2-13**] the patient had an\nepisode of emesis and a fever of 102F.  He was found to be\ntachypneic and was pan cultured and a chest xray was done.  The\nchest xray showed new bibasilar opacities consistent with\naspiration.  He was started on Levaquin and Flagyl (levo to\nfinish on [**2-16**], flagyl to finish on [**2-18**]).  He respiratory\nstatus improved and he was oxygenating well on RA.  He resumed\noral feeding with honey pre-thickened liquids and pureed solids\nwith assistance.  [**2-15**] was transferred to the MICU after he\ndeveloped sudden SOB with destaurations into the 60s and\ntachycardia when being transfered from chair to bed. There was\nno aspiration event noticed. The patient was confused and unable\nto voice complaints. An EKG was concerning for STE in III and\naVF. Cardiology was called but did not think ACS was likely and\nan intervention would be feasible in the light of SDH. The\npatient was transfered to the MICU where he was started on a\nNIPPV.  He was also given aspirin, metoprolol, morphine and\nstarted on Heparin gtt with a goal of PTT 40-60 per\nneurosurgery. Haldol was given for sedation. A Stat ECHO\nrevealed left ventricular systolic function of 30-40% secondary\nto a new basal inferior and posterior hypokinesis as well as to\nrapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. The right\nventricular cavity was dilated with depressed free wall\ncontractility. The patient continued to be tachypneic on the\nNIPPV.  Given worsening respiratory status and obvious patient\ndiscomfort, family meeting was held.  Given poor prognosis,\npatient was made CMO and care was directed towards comfort until\nhe expired on [**2127-2-16**].\n\nCARDIAC: He also complained of some right sided chest pain and\ndyspnea. An EKG was unchanged from previous with no acute ST-T\nchanges.  Cardiac enzymes were drawn and set 1 had a CK of 710\nand troponin of 0.15.  It was felt that the elevation could be\ndue to chronic renal insufficiency, but enzymes were cycled.\nHis enzymes remained stable and he was maintained on ASA.\nExpired [**2127-2-16**].\n\nHYPERNATREMIA: During this admission, he also became\nprogressively hypernatremic which was not responsive to changing\nIV fluids to D5 1/2NS and later D5 1/4NS and given several free\nwater boluses per NGT.  His potassium was repleted to normal\nlevels.  His creatinine increased to 2.4 from baseline of 1.9.\nWith continued hydration with D5W his Na started to improve.\nGiven family wishes for comfort, aggressive free water\nrepleation was stopped and he expired [**2127-2-16**].\n\nCOAGULOPATHY: INR also was found to be increased during the\ncourse of the admission.  This was thought likely to be due to\npoor nutritional status.  He received a dose of vitamin K on\n[**2127-2-13**].  Which did decrease his coagulopathy, was briefly\nstarted on a heparin gtt upon transfer to the MICU given concern\nfor PE vs ACS.  When goals of care changed per family request,\nthis was discontinued as was monitoring of his PTTs.\n\nGiven worsening respiratory status, and patient & family wish to\nnot pursue more aggressive care including intubation, patient\nwas made CMO status on [**2127-2-16**] and expired soon after with his\nfamily at his side.\n\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nspirononlactone, digoxin, DM, Vitamin E, ASA,\nParoxetine, Razyde, Lasix, Flomax.\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nNone, patient expired.\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nExpired [**2127-2-16**].\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired [**2127-2-16**].\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nExpired [**2127-2-16**].\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nExpired [**2127-2-16**].\n\n\n\"\n20325,85669,143622,2177-12-23,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2177-12-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-12-23**]\n\nDate of Birth:  [**2134-6-11**]             Sex:   F\n\nService: MEDICINE\n\nAllergies:\nBactrim Ds\n\nAttending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]\nChief Complaint:\nDysurea\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\nnone\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nMs. [**Known lastname 54530**] is a 43 year-old woman with a history of\nhypertension, obesity s/p gastric bypass who presents with left\nflank pain, was found to be hypotensive in the ED, and is\ntransferred to the MICU for urosepsis.\n.\nShe was in her USOH until yesterday afternoon when she felt\nacute onset left flank pain with subjective fevers and nausea.\nShe denied dysuria.

Troponin 13.5.  She was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization on\nHeparin drip, Integrilin, Plavix and Aspirin.  Cardiac\ncatheterization revealed 100% proximal occlusion of the\ndistal collateral filling, status post successful Hepacoat\nstents times two.  The procedure was complicated by sinus\nnode dysfunction exacerbated by transient no reflow.

Head,\neyes, ears, nose and throat - Extraocular movements are\nintact.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light\nand accommodation. Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck\nrevealed no jugular venous distention.  Respiratory -\nintubated.  Clear breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular\nis regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, II/VI\nholosystolic murmur.  Extremities showed 2+ dorsalis pedis\nbilaterally, warm, no edema.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,\nnondistended.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram precatheterization showed\nsinus at 75 beats per minute, normal axis, early R wave\nprogression, inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction, 2.0\nto 3.0 millimeters, small Q wave, aVL less than 1.0\nmillimeter, ST depressions V5 and V6 with less than 1.[**Street Address(2) 52939**] elevations consistent with prior study.\n\nEchocardiogram on [**2190-12-15**], showed symmetric left ventricular\nhypertrophy, unusually small left ventricular cavity, mild\nregional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting\nregional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral\nakinesis and hypokinesis.  The right ventricular cavity is\ndilated.  Right ventricular systolic function was depressed.\nThe aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened, mild 1+\naortic regurgitation, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, 2+\ntricuspid regurgitation.\n\nCardiac catheterization on [**2190-12-15**], showed left anterior\ndescending 40 to 50% of the mid posterior diagonal, left\ncircumflex 80% at the mid large obtuse marginal, right\ncoronary artery 100% proximally with distal collaterals.\nLeft ventriculogram showed ejection fraction of 40%, severe\nright ventricular hypokinesis.\n\nCreatinine 1.1, hematocrit 37.1.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Coronary artery disease - The patient had initial cardiac\ncatheterization and stents placed to the right coronary\nartery as described above.  She had two right coronary artery\nstents placed and at the time of catheterization had\ntemporary AV pacing wires placed.  She was intubated at the\ntime.  Her catheterization was complicated by bouts of\nbradycardia and hypotension with initial balloon dilation\nrequiring Atropine, Dopamine and right ventricular pacing.\nCoronary sinus pacing wire was placed with continuous\nDopamine drip for augmentation of blood pressure.  During her\nCCU course she ultimately regained intrinsic pacing function\nand her pacing wires were discontinued.  She was started on\nan Aspirin, Plavix, statin, ace inhibitor and beta blocker.\n\nPump function - Echocardiogram as described above.\nInitially, the patient had severe right ventricular\ndysfunction, however, she regained much of her function in\nher right ventricle and subsequent echocardiogram on\n[**2190-12-27**], showed a mildly dilated left atrium, left\nventricular wall thickness, cavity size and systolic function\nare normal with an ejection fraction of 55%.  The right\nventricular cavity was mildly dilated.  Right ventricular\nsystolic function depressed.  Mild 1+ aortic regurgitation,\nmoderate 2+ mitral regurgitation, and compared to the\nfindings of the prior report, the inferior wall motion\nabnormality had resolved.\n\nRhythm - The patient temporarily required AV pacing, however,\nher sinus function was regained and she has maintained a\nnormal sinus rhythm during her hospitalization.\n\n2.  Pulmonary - The patient was intubated in the\ncatheterization laboratory for agitation and initially failed\nextubation secondary to increased granulation tissue around\nthe intubation tubing.  On [**2190-12-28**], she failed a second\nextubation secondary to the airway edema.  On [**2190-12-29**], an\nopen tracheostomy was performed by the ENT service in the\noperating room.  Since that time, she has been progressively\nchanged to smaller and smaller tracheostomy tubes and at the\ntime of this dictation, the expectation is that she will not\nneed a tracheostomy for long term care and that she will\nregain regular upper airway pulmonary function.  However, in\nthe meantime, she will need rehabilitation services.\n\n3.  Gastroenterology - The patient had a history of upper\ngastrointestinal bleed and, while intubated, she was\nmaintained on tube feedings.  After extubation and\ntracheostomy placement, the patient failed a speech and\nswallow test on two separate occasions.  A percutaneous\nendoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed on [**2191-1-4**], for\nfeeding purposes until the time when she is able to swallow\non her own.\n\n4.  Infectious disease - The patient had a period of time\nduring her hospitalization where she had fevers of unknown\netiology.  She completed a course of Vancomycin, Levaquin and\nFlagyl for suspected aspiration pneumonia.  At the time of\nthis dictation, all cultures have not grown anything to date.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility with follow-up\nwith cardiology.

Digibind was given to the patient at the\noutside hospital, and there was no indication for acute\ndialysis.  The precipitating factors of digoxin toxicity were\nthought to be diarrhea and dehydration-induced renal failure,\ncausing decreased clearance of dignoxin.  Digoxin was stopped,\nas was his beta blocker.  Pt's heart rate increased to 70s-80s\nand he was hemodynamically stable.  His digoxin was\ndiscontinued.  He was tried again on his beta blocker prior to\ndischarge, but this again resulted in bradycardia into the low\n50s.\n\n2.  acute on chronic renal failure - Pt's chronic renal failure\nwas thought to be due to long-standing hypertensive disease; pt\nwas also taking continual NSAIDs.  Renal consult was called.\nAcute renal failure was thought likely to be due to ATN due to\nthe course of recovery and post-ATN diuresis; ATN developed most\nlikely in the setting of long-standing dehydration, with NSAID\nuse.  FENa was 1.5%.  A smear for urine eosinophils was\nnegative.  Pt's renal ultrasound showed somewhat enlarged\nkidneys, raising the concern for multiple myeloma; SPEP and UPEP\nwere sent.  Of note, pt had nephrotic range proteinuria on 2\ndifferent urine samples (5.4g/day and 6.5g/day); the etiology\nfor this is unclear, but could be due to minimal change disease.\n Pt will follow up in nephrology clinic.  During the course of\nhis hospitalization, pt's renal function was in the direction of\nrecovery (Cr on admission 3.7, on discharge 2.8, baseline about\n1.3).  Pt had good urine output during his stay and did not\nrequire dialysis.\n\n3.  hyperkalemia - Hyperkalemia was thought to be due primarily\nto acute renal failure, but also with ACE inhibitor and\ntriamterene use.  These drugs were held. Pt's potassium was 7.6\non admission.  He was treated with lasix, Kayexalate, D50, and\ninsulin.  Pt's potassium was better controlled by HD #2 and\nremained stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.\nThis was likely due to renal failure and reolved with\nimprovement of renal function.\n\n4.  diarrhea - Pt's diarrhea had resolved by HD #2.  Stool\nstudies were sent, which were negative for C diff, Salmonella,\nand Shigella.\n\n5.  hypertension - Pt's SBP was around 160s-170s on transfer to\nthe floor.  His baseline per clinic notes seemed to be around\n160s.  This may be a contributing factor to his chronic kidney\ndisease.  Pt's ACE I was held in the setting of acute renal\nfailure; BB was held in the setting of symptomatic bradycardia;\ndiuretics were held in the setting of acute renal failure.\nTherefore, pt was ultimately begun on amlodipine 10mg the day\nprior to discharge, and his SBP over the course of that day\nranged from 140s-160s systolic.\n\n6.  anemia - Pt was guaiac negative.  His Hct was 27.4 on\nadmission.  He received 2 units PRBC with appropriate bump in\nHct.  Iron studies revealed a slightly low TIBC (259), a normal\niron (60) and a normal ferritin (274).  Pt's Hct remained stable\nthrough the rest of his hospitalization and was 33.7 on the day\nof discharge.\n\n7.  depression/anxiety - Pt was continued on Zoloft and\nbuspirone during his hospital stay.  There were no acute issues.\n\n8.  dizziness - pt complained of a couple of episodes of\ntransient dizziness during the last few days of admission.\nDuring these episodes, 12-lead EKGs were normal, he was not\northostatic, and his glucose and other electrolytes were stable.\n He was not unstable on his feet.  He was somewhat confused at\nthe start of one episode, but this resolved within [**10-30**]\nminutes.  Pt reports that he has had multiple episodes of this\nin the past.  He may need further workup as an outpatient.\n\n9.  history of CAD - Pt had recent cardiac catheterization.  He\nwas maintained on his aspirin and Plavix, as well as his statin.\n He may need to be restarted on his beta blocker at some future\ndate, but he likely has nodal disease, as the beta blocker\ncaused significant bradycardia.\n\n10.  FEN/GI - Pt was maintained on a renal, cardiac diet.  He\nwas given IV fluids as needed.\n\n11.

MRI with\nand without contrast showed no evidence for meningitis and no\nenhancing mass lesion. Neurosurgery was consulted and felt no\nintervention needed based on lumbar imaging.  ID consulted, and\nfelt the patient had no clear signs of infection, aside from\nfevers, so antibiotics have been generally held.  Neurology\nassessment was to assess the patient for viral illness,\nincluding viral meningitis, less likely paraneoplastic disorder.\nLumbar puncture was attempted x 4, with records indicating that\none attempt may have yielded venous blood.

Patchy opacities\nare present at both lung bases, and may reflect atelectasis in\nthe setting of low lung volumes. Differential diagnosis includes\naspiration and early infectious pneumonia.

No evidence of spinal or\nparaspinal abscess. Note that if concern exists for focal\ndiscitis or osteomyelitis, MR would be the more sensitive\nmodality for evaluation.\n  2. Nodularity of the pancreas and left adrenal gland. Given\nhistory of\nprevious lung malignancy, metastatic disease is the primary\nconsideration at the pancreas. Additionally, though the adrenal\nnodule is statistically likely an adenoma, metastatic disease\nmust be considered. Ongoing followup is recommended with repeat\nCT within 6 months, or with comparison to prior\nimaging.\n  3. Large bilateral consolidations in the lower lobes\nbilaterally. Given the history of fever and cough reported on\nthe previous chest radiograph, these are concerning for\ninfectious pneumonia. Nevertheless underlying mass is not\nexcluded. Followup to resolution is recommended.\n  4. Large mediastinal lymphadenopathy as detailed above.\n  5. Numerous healing left lateral rib fractures as well as\ndeformity in the right sixth rib, presumably post-surgical.\n----------------\n[**2122-9-18**] EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to reduced\nvoltage,\nslowing, and disorganization of the background rhythm. These\nfindings\nare suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy involving\nboth\ncortical and subcortical structures. Medications,\ntoxic/metabolic\ndisturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.\nThere\nwere no areas of prominent focal slowing although\nencephalopathies can\nobscure focal findings. There were no clearly epileptiform\nfeatures.\n---------------\n[**2122-9-18**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left\nventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic\nfunction are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical\nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully\nexcluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\nare normal. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Limited study. No significant aortic or mitral\nregurgitation seen. Grossly preserved biventricular systolic\nfunction\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n# Fevers: Transferred from outside hospital with pathologic\ndiagnosis of Sweet's Syndrome, based on skin biopsy and\npersistent fevers/leukocytosis. The patient was febrile from his\nfirst day on the floor. Initial infectious workup including\nblood and urine cultures was unrevealing. Stable infiltrate\nopacities on OSH CXR may represent PNA, especially in setting of\nproductive cough. CT of the chest revealed large bilateral\nconsolidations, and the patient was started on broad antibiotic\ncoverage for hospital acquired pneumonia, including vancomycin\nand ceftriaxone. The patient underwent lumbar puncture with IR\nguidance, which yielded ~15 cc of bloody CSF. Initial gram stain\non the CSF revealed gram negative rods, and ampicillin was added\nfor potential listeria meningitis, in the event that the gram\nnegative rods reported on gram stain were actually gram\nvariable. The CSF gram stain findings were subsequently changed\nfrom gram negative rods to \"\"no organisms.\"\" Infectious disease\nwas consulted prior to the above CT findings, and initially\nrecommended holding antibiotic therapy, as well as sending a\nnumber of serologic infectious studies (HSV PCR in CSF, VZV PCR,\nWest [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, Eastern Equine Encephalitis PCR, enteroviral PCR,\nmycoplasma PCR, VDRL per ID). He was treated with broad spectrum\nantibiotics that were eventually tapered to doxycyline.  The\npatient underwnet TTE, to evaluate for fever of unknown origin.\nNo vegetations were noted.  Rheumatology was also consulted, and\nthey recommended tapering the patient's dexamethasone, as the\npatient's fevers were clearly not responding to the steroid\ntreatments. He also underwent bone marrow biopsy; pathology is\npending.\n\n# Mental status changes/Delirium: The patient was clearly\nconfused and disoriented, which--per the family's report--was\nstrikingly different from his baseline cognition/personality.\nPotential etiologies were thought to include infectious\n(meningoencephalitis, abscess or non-CNS infection),\nmetabolic/endocrine (hypercalcemia), renal failure/uremia,\nhepatic encephalopathy, or persistently febrile state. It was\nthought unlikely to be hydrocephalus or brain metastases from\nunknown primary (hx of lung CA), given reportedly normal OSH\nimaging. Toxicology screens were negative. Liver function tests\nwere benign. EEG revealed mild to moderate encephalopathy\ninvolving both cortical and subcortical structures, without\nepileptiform features. The patient's mental status seemed to wax\nand wane somewhat in proportion to his fevers; he would be more\nengaged and responsive to questioning when afebrile.\n\n# Leukocytosis: The patient had reportedly undergone bone marrow\naspiration at the OSH, with findings consistent with\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. His WBC count increased rapidly to\n47,000. Hematology/oncology was consulted and performed another\nbone marrow aspiration to further assess the leukocytosis.\nMarrow analysis is pending.\n\n# Hypercalcemia: Calcium was highly elevated at OSH, where he\nreceived pamidronate treatment prior to transfer. On arrival\ninitial calcium levels were measured at 12.1, with an albumin of\n2.6. PTH levels were elevated at 106. PTHrP was sent off to an\noutside lab. His calcium trended downwards after receiving\npamidronate.  Endocrine was following and suspect primary\nhyperparathyroidism.\n.\n# Hypotension: Per patient's family, he has never had difficulty\nwith high or low blood pressures, and was not on home\nanti-hypertensives. He had had very limited PO intake over the\n2-3 weeks prior to admission. He was initially placed on\nmaintenance IV fluids, and subsequently had the rate of infusion\nincreased.  He transiently required vasopressors while in the\nunit.\n.\n# History of carcinoid syndrome:  His lung cancer was found to\nbe carcinod.  Endocrine was consulted and felt his symptoms were\nunlikely to be carcinoid-mediated.  Chromogranin A and 5-HIAA\nwere sent and are pending.\n.\n# HIT:  His HIT antibody returned positive and he was started on\nArgatroban.  SRA was sent and is pending.  LENIs were negative\nfor clot.\n.\n# Respiratory failure:  Patient required intubation on [**9-19**].\nThis was due to ARDS; he was initiated on ARDSnet ventilation.\nHe had difficultly oxygenating and required high PEEPs directed\nby balloon.\n.\n# Mediastinal lymphadenopathy:  Unclear etiology.  Patient was\nnot stable enough for biopsy.\n.\nPatient acutely decompensated on morning of [**9-25**].  Patient was\nmade CMO by family.  He died that day.

He has undergone several PVI\nprocsdures for AF with his last being complicated by tamponade\nrequiring emergent sternotomy. He now has 3+ MR documented by\nECHO. He is admittedprior to surgery after stopping his coumadin\nfor IV heparin in preparation for surgery.\n\nPast Medical History:\n-Atrial fibrillation\n-Atrial flutter\n-Hyperlipidemia, diet and exercise controlled\n-Mildly elevated LFTs\n.\nCARDIAC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially diagnosed with atrial\nfibrillation approximately four years ago. In [**2169**], he was\nevaluated at [**Hospital1 112**] and subsequently underwent a pulmonary vein\nisolation procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**]. Unfortunately, that\nprocedure was complicated by a left ventricular hematoma and\nperforation resulting in a cardiac tamponade and cardiac arrest.\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was taken emergently to the operating room for relief\nof his tamponade. He was in the intensive care unit for\napproximately 15 days and ultimately discharged one month later.\nUnfortunately, postoperatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 65974**] to atrial\nfibrillation and was discharged on amiodarone.\n.\nIn [**3-28**], he was found to be in atrial flutter, with heart rate\nin the 120s. At that time, his [**Date Range 8863**]-XL dose was increased, he\nfailed DC cardioversion, and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\nIn [**2169-4-22**], he underwent successful ablation of reentry\naround the anterior portion of the CS ostium by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\nwhich was complicated by a prolonged vagal response and\npost-procedure hypotension requiring dopamine infusion, IV\nfluids, and atropine for resolution.  He was admitted to the\nCCU, and at that time developed CHF which was likely  [**2-23**] to\nfluids given for hypotension in setting of decreased HR after\nablation.\n.\nIn [**12-28**], he was found at his follow-up visit to be back in\naflutter. In [**2170-1-22**], a second atrial flutter ablation\nprocedure was performed.\n.\nIn [**1-28**], he had a successful atrial flutter ablation, completion\nof previously done TV-IVC isthmus line of block.\n.\nIn [**3-29**], his amiodarone was discontinued after PFT's revealed a\nmild restrictive physiology and LFT's were found to be elevated.\n.\nIn [**11-29**], he presented again with symptomatic palpitations and\nwas started on Digoxin. He had a repeat PVI on [**2171-1-24**] and\npropafenone was initiated post-procedure.  DCCV on [**2171-1-29**].\n\nSocial History:\nSocial history is significant for the absence of tobacco use.\nThere is no history of alcohol abuse. He was formerly a\nPediatrician for 18 years in [**Country 3992**] prior to emigrating to the\nUS ten years ago. He is married with three sons.\n\n\nFamily History:\nHis father died of complications of diabetes.

Evaluate for\ninfiltrates.\n\n[**Hospital **]: This is the first PA and lateral chest examination\nsince the preoperative study before mitral valve re-do operation\nobtained on [**2171-4-7**]. There is status post sternotomy,\nincluding a row of cutaneous surgical clips in the midline. A\nleft subclavian central venous line is in place, seen to\nterminate overlying the SVC at the level of the carina. No\npneumothorax is identified. The overall heart size is now only\nslightly larger than it was on the pre-re-do examination of\n[**4-7**] and the cardiac configuration remains the same. A\nleft-sided lateral pleural sinus obliteration has developed and\nas it does not continue into the posterior pleural sinus, it\nmost likely represents postoperative scar formations. Comparison\nalso reveals additional linear densities and a relatively\ncrowded vasculature in the left lower lobe consistent with\npartial atelectasis, but no new parenchymal infiltrates are\nidentified. When comparison is made with the most recent single\nview portable chest examination of [**2171-4-19**], the\npreviously present multifocal parenchymal densities as well as\npleural densities have regressed markedly and there is no\nevidence of new acute infiltrates or increased pulmonary\ncongestion. As already noticeable on previous postoperative\nexaminations, there exists a faintly visible semi-circular thin\ndensity consistent with a surgically performed mitral\nannuloplasty.\n\nIMPRESSION: Marked improvement of pulmonary infiltrates\nencountered postoperatively to mitral valve annuloplasty and\nMAZE procedure ([**2171-4-9**]). Moderate cardiomegaly as\nbefore, presently no signs of pulmonary vascular congestion.\nLeft-sided basal scar formations and partial atelectasis.\n\n[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT\n\n[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 65979**]       [**Hospital1 18**] [**Numeric Identifier 65980**]Portable TEE\n(Complete) Done [**2171-4-12**] at 7:47:12 AM      FINAL\nReferring Physician     [**Name9 (PRE) **] Information\n[**Name9 (PRE) **], [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 18**]/Department of Anesthesia\n[**Hospital1 41690**], CC540\n[**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 718**]\n\n[**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**], [**First Name3 (LF) 412**]\nDivision of Cardiothoracic [**Doctor First Name **]\n[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]\n[**Hospital Unit Name 4081**]\n[**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 718**]  Status: Inpatient DOB: [**2116-5-23**]\nAge (years): 54 M  Hgt (in): 69\nBP (mm Hg): 104/60  Wgt (lb): 160\nHR (bpm): 64  BSA (m2): 1.88 m2\nIndication: TEE for evaluation of ?shunt Left ventricular\nfunction.

The patient is recently status post\nmitral valve replacement.\n\nCOMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT [**2171-4-15**].\n\nTECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT followed by CT angiogram of the\nneck, head and circle of [**Location (un) 431**] after Optiray IV contrast with\nmultiplanar reformats and 3D reconstructions.\n\nCT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Overall, the appearance of\nthe brain is unchanged compared to [**2171-4-15**]. There is no evidence\nof intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline\nstructures, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or vascular territorial\ninfarction. Paranasal sinus mucosal thickening has improved and\nthere is mild residual mucosal thickening of the floor of the\nright maxillary sinus and of the left sphenoid sinus air cell.\nThere remains a small amount of fluid and a few bilateral\nmastoid air cells; however, a majority of air cells remain well\naerated.\n\nCT ANGIOGRAM OF THE NECK WITH IV CONTRAST: The carotid and\nvertebral circulations are patent without evidence of aneurysm,\nstenosis, dissection or vascular malformation. At a level\nslightly superior to the carotid bifurcation, the left internal\ncarotid artery measures 10 mm maximal diameter. Slightly\ninferior to the skull base, the left ICA measures 5 mm. At\nsimilar reference levels, the right internal carotid artery\nmeasures 9 and 6 mm respectively. Limited visualization of the\nupper lungs demonstrate airspace consolidation at both apices as\nwell as moderate-sized pleural effusions layering dependently.\n\nCT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD AND CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The anterior and\nposterior circulations as well as circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent\nwithout evidence of aneurysm, stenosis, dissection or vascular\nmalformation.\n\nCT PERFUSION: The CT perfusion images are somewhat limited due\nto technical artifacts; although, no definite asymmetric\nperfusion defect is seen.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. No evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage.\n\n2. Unremarkable CT angiogram of the neck, head, and circle of\n[**Location (un) 431**].\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n54 year old man with s/ mv repair\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\nApparent anterior displacement of the lateral masses of C1\nrelative to the occipital condyles is incompletely evaluated on\nthis head CT. Further evaluation with noncontrast CT of the\ncervical spine is recommended.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.\n\nHISTORY: 54-year-old male found to have apparent anterior\ndislocation of the lateral masses of C1 relative to the\noccipital condyles on recent head CT, referred for evaluation of\nthe cervical spine.\n\nCOMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT, [**2171-4-15**].\n\nTECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the cervical spine with\nmultiplanar reformats.\n\n[**Month/Day/Year **]: There is no evidence of fracture or malalignment of\nthe cervical spine. The vertebral body heights are maintained.\nThere is no significant central canal or neural foraminal\nstenosis. There is normal articular alignment of the bilateral\nlateral masses of C1 with their respective occipital condyles.\nThere is no evidence of anterior dislocation of the lateral\nmasses of C1 relative to the occipital condyles which was\nsuspected on a limited evaluation by recent head CT. Paranasal\nsinus mucosal thickening and partial opacification of bilateral\nmastoid air cells are incompletely included in the field of\nview. Ground- glass opacity and interstitial thickening is noted\nof the visualized right lung apex. The patient is intubated with\nterminus out of view.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Normal articulation of the lateral masses of C1 with their\nrespective occipital condyles.\n2. No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.\n3. Paranasal sinus mucosal thickening and bilateral mastoid air\ncells partial opacification not fully evaluated.\n4. Ground-glass opacity at the visualized right lung apex may\nrelate to infection as suspected on the patient's recent chest\nradiographs.\n\nCT ABD W&W/O C  [**2171-4-13**] 1:06 PM\n\nCT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C\n\nReason: pna, bowel ischemia\n\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n54 year old man with unexplained acidosis, question of pna\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\npna, bowel ischemia\nCONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.\n\nINDICATION: Unexplained acidosis, question of pneumonia and\nbowel ischemia.\n\nTECHNIQUE: Axial volumetric images have been obtained through\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis before and after administration of\nIV contrast. Delayed images in the venous phase through the\nabdomen and pelvis have also been obtained. Coronal and sagittal\nreformats were performed.\n\nCT CHEST: There are multifocal airspace opacities within the\nright and left lung, predominantly on the right with evidence of\nground-glass opacities and air bronchograms. There is a\nquestionable small right apical pneumothorax with no evidence of\nmediastinal gas. Endotracheal tube is in place. The heart is\nenlarged with evidence of small amount of pericardial effusion.\nMediastinal catheters are in place. There are shotty mediastinal\nlymph nodes which are all less than 1 cm in diameter in short\naxis. There is no evidence for pleural effusion. There are two\nhypodense nodules within the right thyroid lobe for which an\nultrasound is recommended.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN: The patient is status post recent laparotomy\ntwo days ago. There are residual two small pockets of free air\nsuperior and anterior to the hepatic dome. The liver, the\nspleen, the pancreas, and the bilateral adrenal glands are\nunremarkable. The gallbladder appears slightly thick-walled and\nthis is likely due to the presence of small amount of ascites in\nthe abdomen. There is a short segment of proximal small bowel\nthat is prominent measuring 3.2 cm in diameter. There is no\nevidence of transition point. The remainder of the bowel appears\nunremarkable. This is most likely due to postsurgical changes.\nThere is no evidence of pneumatosis or portovenous gas. Small\namount of free fluid in the abdomen. There are slightly\nprominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes, all of which are\nsubcentimeter in diameter in short axis. There is no evidence of\nhydronephrosis. There is a small left upper pole cyst.\nOtherwise, the bilateral kidneys are unremarkable.\n\nCT PELVIS: The urinary bladder is decompressed with evidence of\nFoley catheter in the bladder. There is a small amount of free\nfluid in the pelvis. There is a right-sided femoral catheter\nwithin the right femoral artery. There is mild subcutaneous\nedema.\n\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: There are no lucent or sclerotic bony lesions.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Evidence of multifocal airspace disease concerning for\nmultifocal pneumonia. [**Hospital **] were communicated to the fellow\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59499**] on [**2171-4-13**] at 4:00 p.m.\n\n2. Questionable small right apical pneumothorax which may be\ntracking from catheter placement. Additional foci of gas in the\nanterior abdominal wall as described may also reflect gas\ntracking from the mediastinal catheters.\n\n3. Two hypodense lesions within the right lobe of the thyroid\nfor which an ultrasound is recommended.\n\n4. Slightly thick-walled gallbladder which may be related to the\nsmall amount of ascites in the abdomen. Focal short segment\ndilatation of jejunum with no evidence of transition point. This\nis most likely post-surgical in nature.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2171-4-8**] for surgical\nmanagement of his mitral valve disease and his atrial\nfibrillation. As he had stopped coumadin, heparin was started as\na bridge to surgery. On [**2171-4-9**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the\noperating room where he underwent a redo sternotomy with a\nmitral valve repair using a 30mm band and a full MAZE procedure.\nPostoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for\nmonitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated.\nThroughout the day, he became progressively agitated with an\nincrease lactate causing acidosis. He was subsequently\nreintubated to protect his sternum and to allow his acidosis to\nclear. He developed copious secretions and an elevated white\nblood cell count. Vancomycin flagyl, ciprofloxacin and ceftaz\nwere continued for coverage. An echo was performed which ruled\nout a ventricular septal defect. The infectious disease consult\nwas obtained and a pneumonia was suspected. The general surgery\nservice was consulted given his acidosis and distended bowel. An\nexploratory laparotomy was performed which was negative. He\ndeveloped rapid atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was\ncontinued. Heparin was also started for anticoagulation. The\nnutrition service was consulted and tube feeds were started for\nnutritional support. The neurology service was consulted\nsecondary to his continued unresponsiveness and CTA imaging was\nnot suggestive of any acute process. An EEG was performed which\nwas also negative. A toxic-metabolic encephalopathy was presumed\npossibly secondary to sedatives. Slowly his confusion and\nagitation improved. He was gently diuresed towards his\npreoperative weight. On [**2171-4-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a catatonic state\nand a head CT scan was performed which was negative. Of note,\nthyroid nodules were seen on his scan which should be followed\nas an outpatient. He quickly improved to his baseline. Later on\n[**4-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated. As Ceftaz and flagyl were\nassociated with increased risk of seizure, they were both\ndiscontinued as they had completed their course. A bedside\nswallowing exam was performed which he failed and tube feeds\nwere continued. On [**2171-4-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was alert, orientated and\nfollowing all commands. Coumadin was resumed for paroxysmal\natrial fibrillation. A repeat swallowing exam was performed on\n[**2171-4-22**] which he proved that he could safely tolerate foods. A\nregular diet was thus started. Later on [**2171-4-22**], he was\ntransferred to the step down unit for further recovery. The\nphysical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his\npostoperative strength and mobility. He continued to make steady\nprogress and was discharged to home on postoperative day 15.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLopressor 50\"\"\nCoumadin 2.5'\nDigoxin 0.125'\nLasix 20'\nProtonix 40'\nLisinopril 5'\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Concentric gallbladder wall\nthickening likely relates to third spacing given the presence of\ncirrhosis and moderate ascites. There is sludge as well as a\ndeveloping stone within the gallbladder. The spleen is markedly\nenlarged, measuring 19.3 cm. There is a moderate quantity of\nfree fluid in the abdomen. The pancreas is not well assessed\nsecondary to overlying bowel gas.\nColor and spectral Doppler imaging was performed of the hepatic\nvasculature.

Diagnostic tap\nsupported diagnosis of SBP with PMN count of 1450, despite the\nslightly hemorrhagic tap. Cause of SBP is currently unknown,\nthough it likely contributed to his significant confusion prior\nto admission. He was treated with ceftriaxone 2g q24hr x 5 days\nand albumin. Repeat tap showed no continued SBP. He was then\nstarted on ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO daily for prophylaxis.\n.\n# Encephalopathy: Patient with noted confusion and garbled\nspeech prior to admission. This is most likely multifactorial\nfrom SBP, as well as acute liver on chronic liver failure and\nnon-compliance with lactulose at home. Along with current\nconfirmed SBP, patient has elevated transaminases in the\nthousands, without a clear source, as RUQ U/S with Doppler\ndemonstrated no portal vein thrombosis and no other medication\nchanges or recent toxins. Mental status cleared with treatment\nof infection and consistent lactulose use.\n\n.\n# Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Presented with decompensated cirrhosis\nwith rising transaminases into the thousands, elevated INR and\nbilirubin, and low albumin. MELD on admission was 40. Infection\nwith organ hypoperfusion was most likely the cause of\ndecompensation. The patient was treated with vitamin K PO for\nelevated INR. EGD demonstrated Grade II non-bleeding varices. He\nwas evaluated by transplant surgery for possible transplant and\ntransferred to the SICU and on [**2174-4-6**] he was taken to the OR for\nABO incompatible liver transplant with splenectomy. He was taken\nto the OR with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. At the time of surgery, they\nproceeded with a side-to-side caval cavostomy due to the size\nmismatch between hepatic veins of the donor and  recipient.\nThere was initially low flow through the portal vein, prior to\ncompleting the portal venous anastomosis, an eversion\nendovenectomy was attempted and this was marginally successful.\nthen once the liver was implanted, completion of a jump graft\nSMV to PV conduit was done, and once hepatic arteries were\ncompleted the liver pinked up. Portal flow was checked intra-op\nby radiology showing satisfactory flow. Once all connections and\nsplenectomy were completed, the patient was markedly\ncoagulopathic and despite the addition of factor VII and blood\nproduct replacement, the medical bleeding was continuing. At\nthat time it was decided to pack the patient with a laparotomy\nsponge, temporary abdominal closure and planned return in 24\nhours for closure.\nOn [**2174-4-7**] the patient was taken back to the OR,an abdominal\nwashout and liver biopsy were done. The abdomen was closed.\nOf note, the patient received plasmapheresis prior to the\ntransplant with splenectomy and received daily plasmapheresis\nthrough [**4-17**] and then again on [**4-19**] in response to Anti A and\nAnti B titers above accepted range. On [**2174-4-20**] the titers were\nnoted to be Anti A 4 and Anti B negative. No further\nplasmapheresis was required and the catheter was removed. Of\nnote, the patient received 7 doses of ATG through POD 6. (575\ngrams total) He received routine ABO incompatible Steroid course\nand then followed prednisone taper per protocol. MMF has been\ngiven at 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] since transplant and Prograf was started on\nPOD 1 from original transplant, and levels have been monitored\nwith dosing changes as appropriate.\nPatient was transferred from the ICU once stable.\nHe was started on tube feeds on POD 7, which seemed to be well\ntolerated, however the existing drains appeared to become more\nmilky in appearance, and the triglyceride level was almost 700.\nThe patient was made NPO, Tube feeds were stopped and the\npatient had a PICC line placed and was started on TPN for bowel\nrest. Over the course of the next few days, the drainage became\nmore serous in appearance again, nutrition consult was obtained\nto find the most low fat tube feed, and he was started on\nVivonex, and was given counseling regarding a low fat diet.\nThe lateral drain was removed on POD 18, and the splenectomy bed\ndrain was removed on POD 23.\nHe was tolerating the new tubes feeds, but still had poor oral\nintake. The patietn was having increased diarrhea with negative\nc diff, and the tube feeds were switched to nepro with\nadditional benefit of lower potassium in feeds. He is tolerating\nthese tube feeds and has now progressed to a regular diet, with\nthe JP drainage remaining serous in appearance.\nHe is ambulating with assist, and has been recommended to be\ndischarged to a rehab facility for further physical therapy.\n.\n# Acute kidney injury: most likely prerenal azotemia from\nhyperperfusion in the context of SBP (with peripheral\nvasodilation). Urine was very concentrated with ketones,\nsuggesting hypoperfusion. Capillary leak from hypoalbuminemia\nalso contributing. Kidney function improved with treatment of\ninfection and administration of albumin. Once the patient\nreceived the liver transplant, his renal function was already\nrecoved, and has continued to be within normal limits\n.\n# Metabolic acidosis: Patient presented with metabolic acidosis\nwith elevated lactate, likely due to intravascular depletion and\nhypoperfusion in the setting of SBP. Also elevated in context of\nliver disease (liver clears 70% of lactate). Lactate trended\ndown to 1.9 with treatment of infection and administration of\nlacutlose. Bicarbonate also corrected to normal.\n.\n# Hyponatremia: Most likely from third-spacing with decreased\nintravascular sensed volume. Patient was supplemented with\nalbumin, with improvement of sodium.  Since liver transplant\nthis has normalized\n.\n#. Cachexia: Very cachectic, secondary to cirrhosis. Dobhoff for\nsupplemental nutrition was placed at the time of EGD, but\npatient self-discontinued this tube. Tube feeds with Vivonex at\n95cc/hr were initiated post chyle leak. He developed some\ndiarrhea with this tube feed, and has now been switched to Nepro\nwith improved tolerance.\nPatient is now ambulating with assistive device and physical\ntherapy\n.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Acute on chronic\nsystolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 40% [**5-/2147**], mild pulm edema on\nCXR at OSH) and aspiration in the setting of Parkinson's dz also\nconsidered, esp w witnessed aspiration of chicken broth as\ninpatient. ACS/PE seemed less likely, cardiac enzymes negative.\nSputum grew GNRs and Proteus, for which Meropenem was started\nfor a 10-day course ([**Date range (1) 51975**]). Blood cxs negative.\nBronchoscopy was performed and pt taken to the OR for\ntracheostomy and T-tube placement for suctioning. Necrotic skin\nwas seen around the incision, hence vancomycin was started for a\n10-day course ([**Date range (1) 72760**]). The COPD exacerbation was treated\nwith prednisone initially with 40mg, with plan for taper over 15\ndays.  Taper should begin on [**6-5**] at 20mg through [**6-7**], then\n10mg on [**6-8**] to [**6-10**], then 5mg on [**6-11**] to [**6-13**], then 2mg [**6-14**] to\n[**6-16**], then 1mg [**6-17**] to [**6-19**].  Patient was also treated with\nbronchodilators/acetylcysteine nebs and supplemental oxygen as\nneeded. Pt evaluated w video speech and swallow, showed\nDysphagia Outcome\nSeverity Scale (DOSS) rating of level 5, mild dysphagia,\nrecommended repeat instrumental evaluation at rehab prior to\nupgrading patient's diet or if patient continues to improve.\nTracheostomy capped on discharge, which the pt is tolerating\nwell. Oxygenating on room air > 93%.\n.\n# tracheostomy site: it was felt patient had a tracheostomy site\ninfection, was initiated on vancomycin on [**5-29**], with plan to\ncomplete 10d course, to end [**6-8**].\n.\n# Acute renal failure: Cr 1.5 up from recent baseline of Cr ~1.\nLikely prerenal in the setting of diuresis, poor PO intake and\nacute processes (infection).

Removal of coronary sinus lead.\n2.  Multilevel Intercostal  nerve block.\n\nOPERATIVE INDICATIONS:  The patient is an 83-year-old\ngentleman who had previously undergone percutaneous lead\nplacement attempt. This was unsuccessful, and as such, the\npatient presented with the desire for thoracoscopic\nplacement. After discussion with the patient, it was decided\nto proceed with thoracoscopic placement.  The risks and benefits\nas well as possible benefits were explained to the patient\nincluding but not limited to bleeding, infection, MI, CVA,\nDeath, nerve damage, heart damage, and lung damage and possible\nblood transfusion and he agreed to proceed. All questions were\nanswered to his satisfaction prior to proceeding with the\nprocedure.\n\nOPERATIVE COURSE:  The patient was brought to the operating\nroom and placed on the operating table. After the induction\nof general endotracheal anesthesia, a right internal jugular\ncentral line was placed. A transesophageal echocardiogram\nmonitor was used during the case. After anesthesia had\ncompleted their invasive line, the patient was turned in the\nright lateral decubitus position with the left side up. The\nleft thorax was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. A\n2 cm incision was made along the fifth intercostal space. A\ntrocar was inserted. About a 10 mm 30 degree scope was\ninserted. Upon inspection of the thorax, there was no\nevidence of any abnormalities. The heart was fairly large.\nTwo other trocars were inserted, one in approximately the\nsixth intercostal space and the other in the posterior\nposition. Two  graspers were used to elevate the pericardium.\nA knife was used to incise the pericardium sharply, taking\ncare not to injure the myocardium. Next, the pericardium was\nelevated and retracted, allowing access to the myocardium and\nepicardium. Two epicardial leads were placed, using a device\nwhich was able to screw the leads onto the epicardium. Each\nepicardial lead was tested and was deemed to be working\nappropriately with acceptable thresholds.\n\nOnce the lead had been placed, there were no areas of\nbleeding after placement of the leads. Two chest tubes were\nplaced, both in the left hemithorax.\n\nThen, the patient's previous pacemaker/defibrillator pocket  was\nopened. We then tunneled the two leads to the infraclavicular\npocket. The\ncoronary sinus lead was evaluated and was removed by simple\ntraction. At this\npoint, the 2 left ventricular leads were attached to a Y\nconnector and were\ndeemed to be working appropriately after attachment. The\nserial [**Serial Number 67550**]. The Y addapter was then connected to the\npacer/defibrillator box and resecured in the pocket after\nmeticulous hemostasis was achieved. All thoracic incisions were\nclosed in layers\n\nWe then performed a multilevel intercostal nerve block with 1/4%\nmarcaine with epi\n\n                        [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10585**], MD [**MD Number(2) 10586**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 67551**]\nPost operative course:\nSOB: Patient has baseline SOB from heart failure. He stated that\non post operative day 3 from procedure, his shortness of breath\nwas improved somewhat from prior to procedure. He underwent\ndaily physical therapy consults, which demonstrated improved\nfunctionality, although the patient had some orthostatic\nhypotension and decreased oxygen saturation on ambulation. He\nfound manual respiratory exercises (percussion with cough)\nperformed by the physical therapist to be very helpful for his\nshortness of breath. The patient was euvolemic on presentation\nand appeared not to require his outpatient lasix dose, probably\ndue to improved heart function. By the end of his stay he had\ndeveloped some mild fluid overload and was discharged on lasix\n40 mg every other day with instructions to titrate up or down\nunder the direction of his primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] ejection\nfraction was measured as 35% with TTE postoperatively.\n.\nPost-op skin care: The patient had chest tubes postoperatively\nwhich were removed without complication and was discharged with\ninstructions on care for the wound sites.

Heparin and plavix\nwere continued for anticoagulation despite being therapeutic on\ncoumadin. Steroids and nebulizer treatments were given to\nimprove his hypoxia with good results. Given the nature of his\nclot in relation to his pacemaker, the cardiac surgical service\nwas consulted for surgical removal of his pacer lead and atrial\nclot. Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner\nand despite being such high risk, it was elected to proceed. The\nelectrophysiology service was consulted for interrogation of his\npacemaker and to make adjustments to assist with his\nhypotension. Given his acute renal failure, the renal service\nwas consulted. A temporary line was placed for hemodialysis by\nthe radiology service. As a hypercoagulable state was suspected,\nappropriate studies were sent per the hematology service. On\n[**2120-8-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] was taken to the operating room where he\nunderwent removal of a right atrial clot, closure of PFO,\nplacement of pacer leads and placement of a new pacemaker.\nPostoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive\ncare unit for monitoring. An emergency echocardiogram was\nobtained for deteriorating hemodynamics. No significant\npericardial effusion was seen however mobile thrombus was seen\nin the right atrium. His sternum was opened at the bedside and\nCPR was initiated with success. His family was made aware of the\ngrave situation and supportive care was withdrawn.

Significant interval decrease in the\nsize of the right hepatic lobe collection drained by the pigtail\ncatheter.\n2. Significant interval increase in inferior right hepatic\nabscess which is not drained by the indwelling catheter. A\nsecond percutaneous catheter placement may be needed to drain\nthis collection.\n3. Unchanged hypodense lesion within the left lobe of the liver,\nwhich may represent a metastasis or a focus of infection.\n4. Probably mild interval increase in intrahepatic biliary\nductal dilatation compared to [**2-12**], though comparison\nis difficult given differences in technique. There is a small\namount of pneumobilia centrally within the liver, suggesting at\nleast partial patency of the common bile duct stent.\n5. Large amount of stool throughout the colon.\n.\n[**2132-3-26**] CXR: 1. No evidence of pneumonia. Air within the\ninferior right lobe of the liver is located within an abscess,\nas seen on CT.\n2. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate.\n.\n[**2132-3-27**] ERCP: Previous placed stent had completed obstructed.\nThis was removed.\nBiliary stricture compatible with malignant biliary stricture in\nthe middle third of the common bile duct and at the bifurcation.\nA 60 mm X 10 mm covered wall stent was placed.\n.\n[**2132-3-30**] CXR: Worsening bilateral pleural effusions with likely\ndeveloping fluid overload/failure.\n.\n[**2132-3-31**] ECHO: The left ventricular cavity size is normal.

Patient underwent ERCP for stent replacement\nas well as placement of a percutaneous abscess drain done by\nradiology.  LFTs steadily improved s/p ERCP.  He was maintained\non daptomycin and meropenem in house but will complete his\ncourse on vancomycin and meropenem, given enterococcus is\nsensitive to vancomycin.  Please check vancomycin trough on\n[**2132-4-4**].  Plan for at least 4 weeks of antibiotics.  Patient is\nscheduled for follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of infectious\ndiseases to follow-up an interval CT and for possible\ndiscontinuation of his drain based on the CT.  A PICC is in\nplace for antibiotics.  He has been hemodynamically stable and\nafebrile with these treatment interventions.\n.\n# Liver abscess: Abd CT showed decreased size of prior right\nlobe abscess (pigtail in place), but new inferiorly located\nright liver abscess (~ 6 cm).  Discussed with patient and his\nHCP; he would not want surgery but was agreeable to IR drainage.\n Aspirin was held and procedure done.  His other drain was\ndiscontinued.  Biliary stent also replaced this admission, which\nmay have been a contributing factor.\n.\n# Systolic CHF: Patient noted to have EF 25-35% on ECHO done to\nrule out an overt vegetation.  He also complained of worsening\nshortness of breath and had a chest xray which suggested\nworsening CHF.  Patient was diuresed and creatinine remained\nstable.  He remains stable on room air.  He has been started on\nan ACEI and will need qd weight and dietary restriction for\ncontinued management.\n.\n# Altered mental status: Improved.  Still agitated at night.\nRemeron restarted.  Likely infection is contributing.  TSH and\nB12 in normal range.\n.\n# Cholangiocarcinoma: Presumed based on imaging, not\nbiopsy-proven. Evidence of liver mets. Pt does not desire\nchemo/surgery.\n.\n# Iron deficiency anemia:  Hematocrit stable at 33.  Labs from\n[**2-6**] suggest iron deficiency.  Patient started on po supplement.\n\n# DNR/DNI: confirmed with pt and HCP. During prior admit, there\nwas discussion of possible hospice placement. The patient/HCP\nclearly state that they want minimally invasive procedures\n(ERCP, abscess drainage) but are declining surgery. Palliative\ncare was consulted and assisted in discussions with patient.\n.\n7) HCP: [**Name (NI) **], [**Name (NI) 717**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 66201**]\n\nMedications on Admission:\nRemeron 15mg QHS\nASA 81mg daily\nMVI daily\nSenna 2tabs QHS\nProtonix 40mg daily\nColace 100mg TID\nPercocet 1-2tabs Q4hr prn\nZofran 4mg Q6hr prn\nRISS\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Patient is\nwheelchair bound. According to notes, pt has been developed\nchest pressure and shortness of breath on day of admission to\nOSH.  He had a few episodes of this pressure during\nhospitalization at [**Hospital1 46**].  The chest pressure occured along\nwith some sob, nausea and right shoulder pain.  Denied\ndiaphresis.  He had trop of 0.09. ECG showed intermittent CHB on\nadmission to osh.  Because of this he was taken of BB.  An Echo\nwas performed, revealing an EF of 30%.   He was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] for w/u of possible cardiomyopathy and catheterization.\n.\nPt was admitted initially admitted to cardiology [**Hospital1 **].

The right atrium and right ventricle pacemaker\nleads inserted on the left are in standard positions. No\npneumothorax or a pleural effusion. The heart size is enlarged\nand the aorta is tortuous and calcified.\nMultiple bilateral pleural plaques, including the bilateral\ncostal pleura and bilateral diaphragmatic pleural surfaces\nsuggest previous asbestos related disease.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Standard position of the pacemaker.\n2. Unchanged appearance of the bilateral pleural plaques\nconsistent with prior asbestos exposure.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt is a 85 yom with h/o DM, paroxysmal afib, severe peripheral\nvascular disease s/p multiple bypass grafts, copd and remote MI,\nwho was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardiac\ncatheterization and EP evaluation.\nThe pt was initially admitted to the cardiology [**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital1 18**],\nwhere, after recieving a dose of beta-blocker before bedtime, he\nhad 20 minutes of complete heart block.  The episode was\nasymptomatic.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for closer\nobservation and placement of a temporary pacemaker wire, which\nwas uncomplicated.  The following day ([**6-1**]) pt had a permanent\npacer implanted (DDD).  Since admission to [**Hospital1 18**] the pt has had\nlow BP's (SBP-80's to 100's & occasionally lower).  His\nanti-hypertensives were held because of this.  The pt was noted\nto be volume overloaded, and was given IV Lasix (20mg) PRN.  He\ndiuresed well, and his SBP would often improve following\ndiuresis.  This lead us to conclude that he likely had active\nCHF, leading to poor forward flow & a pre-renal state.  Because\nof this, he discharged on PO lasix.\n.\nOther issues:\n.\n#) CV\n-CAD: Given pt's h/o CAD, he was treated with ASA, statin, &\nplavix during his admission.  Once BP improved, b-blocker\ntherapy was resumed; however, he was unable to tolerate more\nthan a few doses.  His ACEi was also held because of low BP.\nThe pt did not have CP/pressure during his admission here.  At\n[**Hospital3 3583**] the pt did have chest pressure and borderline\nelevated troponins.  However, given the pt's age & physical\nstatus (minimal activity & wheelchair bound), we felt that the\nrisks of cardiac catheterization out weighed the benefits, and,\nthus, we did not pursue catheterization during this admission.\n-Pump: Pt reportedly had an EF=30% from an echo done at OSH.  He\ndid show signs of volume overload and presumed CHF while here,\nwhich were treated with diuresis.\n-Rhythm: Episode of complete heart block treated with permanent\npacemaker.\n.\n#) Renal - The pt was in acute renal failure (thought to be\npre-renal) with Crt peaking at 1.8 and trending down to 1.5\nafter diuresis.  (It was thought that due to volume overload and\nCHF, the pt had poor forward flow, leading to hypo-perfusion of\nhis kidneys.)\n.\n#) PVD - Patient has an extensive history of lower extremity\nbypass surgeries.  He was noted to have two left lower extremity\nulcers which were treated with wound care.  No evidence of\ncellutis.\n.\n#) Diabetes - The pt's home gluburide was discontinued while\nhospitalized and he was covered with RISS.  He will be\ndischarged on glypizide (rather than glyburide) given his\ndecreased renal function: crt clearance estimated at 33.\n.\n#) Paroxysmal afib. - no documented a. fib on tele at OSH or at\n[**Hospital1 18**].  Coumadin was re-started here following EP recomendation.\n However, it was later discontinued as pt was felt to be at high\nrisk for falls and would be receiving aspirin and plavix for his\nCAD.\n.\n# )COPD - Patient has history of emphysema (20 pack-year smoking\nhistory) and asbestos exposure.  He was given nebulizers &\ninhalers prn.\n.\n# AAA - per outside records, pt has AAA of ~2 cm width.  No\ninterventions undertaken while in hospital.\n.\n#) Thrombocytopenia - Pt's plts were noted to have dropped from\n159 to 130 at OSH, and initially 125 here.  Cause unclear.  It\nresolved on it's own.\n.\n#) Dispo - Based on pt's inability to perform his baseline\nphysical activities (ie, transferring, etc...), physical therapy\nrecommended that pt go to rehab for further strengthening and\nconditioning prior to going home.  Pt initially refused, but\nlater agreed once his family discussed the issue with him.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nCoumadin 2mg qd\nGlyburide\nIsosorbide dinitrate\nAtenolol 25mg qd\nLipitor\nFlomax\nPepcid\nAspirin 81mg PO qd\nPlavix 75mg PO qd (loaded at OSH)\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The heart\nsize is stable with atherosclerotic calcifications noted within\nthe coronary arteries as well as within the thoracic aorta.\nThere is no significant pericardial effusion. No lymphadenopathy\nis appreciated. The thyroid remains heterogeneous with isthmic\nand right-sided hypodensities suggestive of nodules.\n\nWithin the lungs, again noted is fibrosis and traction\nbronchiectasis involving primarily the upper lobes. In addition,\nthere is a newly apparent more consolidative opacity in the\nright upper lobe, tracking along the fissure and to a lesser\nextent in the left upper lobe also along the fissure. There are\nno pleural effusions. The central airways are patent.\n\nIn the visualized upper abdomen, note is made of an incompletely\nevaluated large hypodense left upper quadrant mass whose\nappearance is similar to the prior studies, measuring upwards of\n9 cm. A calcified retrocrural lymphadenopathy is also noted and\nunchanged. A hypodense posterior right lobe of the liver lesion\nis stable.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. New opacity tracking along the major fissures bilaterally in\nthe upper lobes is suspicious for superimposed infection in the\nsetting of chronic changes due to sarcoid.\n\n2. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.\n\n3. Enlarged pulmonary arteries, unchanged.\n\n4. Large left upper quadrant abdominal mass and retrocrural\ncalcified lymphadenopathy, similar to prior studies and\ncompatible with metastatic disease.\n\n5.

Initial evaluation\nwas generally unremarkable with LENIs negative for DVT, CTA not\nsuggestive of PE. She was diuresed with lasix prn. She also had\nher pain medications uptitrated and in the setting of her new\npain regimen, she developed hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory\ndistress on [**2177-4-14**], necessitating transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and\nNIPPV. At that time, her initial ABG was notable for PCO2 of\n132. Patient improved significantly after receiving BiPap and\nwas called out to the floor.\nAgain on the floor she developed increased confusion on [**4-18**] with\nslow response to questions and PCO2 of 97. She received NIPPV\novernight and improved and was called out to floor. On the floor\nshe received BIPAP at night. Received 500cc [**4-21**] for hypovolemic\nhyponatremia and 1000cc on [**4-22**], and 1 unit PRBCs on [**4-23**].\nDeveloped increased RR on [**4-23**] to 26-30 and CXR was c/w volume\noverload. She received 20 IV lasix on [**4-23**].\nDuring her course her O2 was again increased to 97-100% and she\ndeveloped progressive somnolence. ABG was 7.26/99/32, placed in\nBIPAP without improvement (7.22/107/62). She was given 40 IV\nlasix and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for noninvasive ventilation.\nIn the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was started on bipap.  Respiratory therapy was\nconsulted and she transitioned to bipap at night only.  Her\nmental status and O2 sats improved and she remained on 3L nasal\ncanula during the daytime.\n\nAgain 2 days later the patient developed mild confusion with\nslow response to questions. ABG at that time was notable for\nPCO2 97. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of\nNIPPV.\nDuring her hospital course patient had numerous transfers to the\nICU for mental status changes and respiratory failure, which\nbecame increasingly difficult to control, she was DNR/DNI and\nremained BiPAP dependant. On [**4-30**] her respiratory status did not\nrespond to NIPV and she died in hypercarbic respiratory failure.\n\n\nRemaining hospital course by issues:\n\n.\n#. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: pt c/o SOB, O2 2L with O2\nsat of 92% and initial improvement of her symptoms. Etiology of\npatient's propensity towards hypercarbic distress was likely her\nmultiple primary pulmonary pathologies, including pulmonary\nhypertension, sarcoidosis, diastolic dysfunction, and presumed\nobstructive sleep apnea. These, coupled with narcotic use for\npain related to malignancy require careful management to prevent\ninappropriately high bicarbonate levels. Treated with BiPAP\n8/5/30%, aimed to avoid further sedating medications, continued\nhydroxychloroquine and prednisone for sarcoidosis, continued\nsildenafil for pulmonary hypertension and albuterol prn.\n.\n#. Hyponatremia: presentation and urine lytes c/w SIADH in the\nsetting of pulmonary disease. Fluid restriction of 1.5L, and\ncontinued salt tabs. TSH cortisol normal and less likely to\ninclude in the differential.\n.\n#. Anemia: stable, continued ferrous sulfate.\n#. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine 25mcg PO daily\n.\n#. Anxiety: low-dose ativan PRN.\n.\n#. Hypertension: continued nifedipine and metoprolol\n.\n#. Pain control: Acute Pain consult requested by ICU team prior\nto transfer. Fentanyl TD increased from 12 to 25 mcg/hour.\nPatient refused morphine PCA, as recommended. Continued fentanyl\nTD at increased dose, continue standing acetaminophen 1 g q6\nhours, oxycodone PRN, Neurontin 300 mg qHS.\n- f/u Pain Service recs\n.\n#.

Briefly Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 98372**] was diagnosed with\nmetastatic Colon cancer in [**2148**] and treated with resection and\n5FU / Leucovorin. Unfortunately she had a recurrence in [**2152**]\nwith mets to liver and lungs. She has had multiple biliary\nstents placed in the past for obstructive disease. Recently her\nbilirubin has been elevated and she has undergone several ERCP's\nwith Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] who was unable to remove all of the sludge\ndistal to the stents. Her chemotherapy regimen has been held for\nthe past several weeks due to the elevated bili and it was\nrecommended that she have the percutaneous biliary procedure\nwhich was performed on [**6-6**].  She was then re-admitted on [**6-12**]\nat which time IR replaced her percutaneous biliary drain.\n.\nAccording to the preliminary procedure documentation:\n1. Previously placed metal stent was seen in the major papilla\nwith distal occlusion.\n2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon\ncatheter using a free-hand technique.\n3. Cholangiogram showed partial stent occlusion with a normal\nright hepatic system. The left hepatic system was dilated with\nthe external biliary drain in place.\n4.

Previously placed metal stent was seen in the\nmajor papilla with distal occlusion.\n2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon\ncatheter using a free-hand technique.\n3. Cholangiogram showed partial stent occlusion with a normal\nright hepatic system. The left hepatic system was dilated with\nthe external biliary drain in place.\n4. Biliary Sludge was extracted from the biliary stent with a\nballoon catheter.\n.\n[**6-19**] Tube cholangeogram\nIMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 8.5-French right biliary\ndrainage tube, placed through the stent within the common bile\nduct into the duodenum for internal drainage.\n\nSuccessful replacement of pre-existing left biliary drainage\ntube with a 6F nephrostomy catherter for external drainage.\n.\n[**6-21**] CXR\nThere is a large mass (4.7 x 5.7 cm) at the left lung apex.\nAllowing for low inspiratory volumes, no CHF, focal infiltrate\nor effusion is identified. The patient's numerous pulmonary\nnodules are faintly visible. Drains noted over the upper\nabdomen. No acute pneumonic infiltrate identified. Tip of right-\nsided Port- A-Cath type catheter overlies the SVC/RA junction.\n.\n[**6-21**] EGD:\nImpression: The esophagus was normal.\nThe stomach was normal with no blood within.\nThe ampullary area was examined using a duodenoscope. There was\na small mount of ooze around the previously placed metal stent.\nThe IR placed biliary stent could be seen within the metal\nstent. There was no blood draining from the stent. The ooze was\nflushed several times and seemed to be originating from the\nperiampullary area secondary to trauma from IR stent insertion\n+/- metal stent change of position. The oozing had stopped by\nthe end of the procedure.\n.\n[**6-21**] GI Bleeding study:\nINTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous\nred blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic\nimages of the abdomen for 90 minuteswere obtained. A left\nlateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.\n\nDynamic blood pool images show increased uptake throughout\npossibly small bowel seen only in the delayed images (60-90).\nThe precise cause of the increased uptake or the location cannot\nbe determined.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nIncreased uptake possibly in the small bowel seen only in the\ndelayed images (60-90min) likely representing slow upper GI\nbleeding.\n.\n[**6-25**] CT Abd/Pelvis:\nCT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple lung nodules at\nthe lung bases. The largest is located within the left lower\nlobe and measures 2.9 x 2.1 cm and previously measured 2.7 x 2.0\ncm. A right upper lobe nodule has increased in size and now\nmeasures 0.6 x 0.6 cm (series 4, image 1). The patient is status\npost PTC and two catheters are seen within the liver entering\nvia frontal and right lateral approaches. There is a small\namount of perihepatic and perisplenic ascites. A common bile\nduct stent is unchanged in appearance. The subcapsular mass in\nthe lateral right lobe which previously measured 2.1 x 2.2 cm is\nnow ill- defined, perhaps secondary to phase of contrast\nadministration, but measures approximately 2.2 x 1.2 cm. There\nremains mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, which has\ndecreased and an expected small amount of pneumobilia. There is\nevidence of tumor extension up the porta hepatis encircling the\nleft portal vein, decreased compared to the prior study. Lymph\nnodes within the porta hepatis, some with mucinous calcification\nare unchanged.\n\nA cystic lesion in an enlarged spleen is stable. Cysts in the\nright kidney are also unchanged. The pancreas, right adrenal\ngland, left kidney, and stomach are unremarkable. A new 1.6 x\n1.0 cm left adrenal nodule likely represents metastasis. Small\nretroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet criteria for pathologic\nenlargement. There is a small ventral hernia containing\nunremarkable appearing mesentery.\n\nCT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, bladder, and uterus are\nunremarkable. There is mild sigmoid diverticulosis. There are no\nenlarged lymph nodes and no free fluid within the pelvis.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1. Interval progression of disease. New left adrenal lesion\nsuspicious for metastasis. Enlargement of right upper lobe\npulmonary nodule. The right lateral hepatic lesion is more\nill-defined but has likely mildly decreased in size as has tumor\nextending up the porta hepatis.\n.\n[**6-26**] Cholangiogram:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Bilateral cholangiograms performed demonstrate decompressed\nsystem and right-sided biliary catheter retracted into the liver\nparenchyma. The left- sided biliary catheter presents in good\nposition and drainage of the left- sided biliary ducts.\n2. Successful exchange for right-sided biliary catheter for a 10\nFrench biliary catheter, the pigtail was coiled in the duodenum.\n.\n[**6-30**] CXR\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Smaller apparent size of left apical mass, which may related\nto technique. If detailed comparison for interval change is\ndesired, then PA and lateral radiographs could be helpful.\n\n2. Bibasilar opacities, probably atelectasis\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nA/P: 70 F metastatic colon ca admitted for for ERCP to dilate\npost-stent stenosis of CBD.\n# Hyperbilirubinemia:  It was never completely clear why we were\nunable to get her bilirubuin down further than we did.  The CT\nscan did not show progression of disease. ? [**2-15**] paraneoplastic\nsyndrome.  However, after multiple ERCP/IR procedures (detailed\nbelow), her bilirubin started to trend down by discharge.\n- On [**6-18**], she underwent successful ERCP during which they\ndilated the distal CBD stent stenosis.  She was started on\nLevofloxacin after this procedure.\n- On [**6-19**], IR placed a drain to her R biliary system that was\nalso internalized to her duodenum.  They also replaced her L-\nbiliary drain (this could not be internalized).\n- On [**6-21**], she had a lg amt of marroon blood per rectum.  A\nbleeding scan suggested an upper-GI bleed.  She was transferred\nto the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and an EGD was performed which showed a slow bleed\nfrom around the site of entry of the CBD into the duodenum,\nthought to be secondary to prior procedures.  The bleeding had\nstopped by the end of th EGD.  Her hct was stable and she did\nnot require any transfusions during her hospital course.\n- On [**6-21**], the same day that she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she\nspiked a fever to 101.  CXR did not show a PNA and UA did not\nshow a UTI. Vanc/Zosyn were started with concern for biliary\nsource with possible catheter-site infection.  On approximately\n[**6-27**], Vancomycin was stopped and she was switched to unasyn,\nbased on sensitivities (her biliary fluid grew out enterococcus\nand K. pneumoniae.)  On [**6-30**], cipro was added based on new\nsensitivity data for the K. pneumoniae and the fact that she\nspiked a low-grade fever.  She remained afebrile for the\nremainder of her hospital course.  On discharge, she was sent\nout on augmentin and cipro to be taken ongoing.\n- On [**6-26**], IR performed another cholangiogram as her bilirubin\nwas persistently elevated and her drains seemed only to be\nintermittently draining.  They increased her R drain to a 10 F\nand showed that the L drain was working.\n- Prior to d/c we also consulted Hepato-biliary surgery.  They\nstated that they could offer her a surgical procedure to attempt\nto provide better drainage but based on the fact that here bili\nbegan to trend down and her drains seemed to be working, she\ndecided to defer surgery for now.  She will have a f/u\nappointment w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.\n- She is at very high risk for infection given her 2 biliary\ndrains.\n.\n# Hpothyroidism: cont armour\n.\n# HTN: atenolol held during her gi-bleed and for approx 6 days\nafter and re-started at a lower dose prior to d/c\n- d/c of quinipril as did not seem to need it\n.\n# Metastatic colon cancer: tx per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] covering\ninitially and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] took over her care prior to D/c)\n- her colon cancer does not appear to be very agressive but she\nlikely cannot receive any further chemotherapy [**2-15**]\nhyperbilirubinemia\n- [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] will continue to follow her bilirubin/CBC as\nan outpatient.\n.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPlavix 75 mg once daily (held X 14 days), quinapril 60 mg daily,\nProtonix 40 mg b.i.d., atenolol 50 mg once daily, citalopram 60\nmg once daily, Armour 120 mg daily.

Non-obstructive stone in the lower pole of the right kidney.\n\n[**2137-12-25**] CT head:\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process to explain\npatient's\naltered mental status.\n\n[**2138-1-1**] ECHO:\nIMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.\nMildly dilated right ventricle with abnormal septal motion\nconsistent with RV pressure/volume overload. Mild pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension. Trivial to very small pericardial\neffusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-11-21**],\nthere is interventricular septal flattening consistent with\nright ventricular pressure/volume overload. The estimated\npulmonary artery systolic pressure is greater, but may have been\nunderestimated on the prior study. The pericardial effusion is\nslightly smaller.\n\n[**2138-1-1**] Portable CXR:\nIMPRESSION: Right basal opacity could reflect aspiration or\npneumonia.\n\n[**2138-1-3**] Portable CXR:\nFINDINGS: Endotracheal tube ends 3.6 cm above the carina and is\nappropriate in position, orogastric tube courses below the\ndiaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is off\nradiograph view and left internal jugular line ends at lower\nSVC. Since [**2138-1-2**] right upper pneumonia has worsened and\nmoderate to large right pleural effusion persists. Left lung is\nclear, no effusion. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours\nare normal.\n\n[**2138-1-4**] RUQ ultrasound:\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Sludge within an otherwise normal appearing gallbladder.\n2. Large volume ascites.\n3. Right pleural effusion.\n4. Patent TIPS.\n\n[**2138-1-7**] Echo:\nNo atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left\nventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular\ncavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a\nfocal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left\nventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is\nno ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is\nmildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is\nabnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)\nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is\nno valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity\nis likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally\nnormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral\nvalve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-1-1**],\nthe estimated PASP has increased slightly.\n\n[**2138-1-8**]  abdominal US w doppler:\nKidneys are extremely echogenic and there is reduced\ncorticomedullary\ndifferentiation suggesting significant impairment.\nMild fullness of the proximal ureters are seen, but there is no\ngood evidence of hydronephrosis. There is a 1.5 cm calculus in\nthe left kidney. There is likely a left-sided nephrostomy. The\nright kidney measures 12 cm. The left kidney measures 11.2 cm.\nThere is a lower pole 9 mm right-sided non obstructing calculus.\n\nCONCLUSION: Bilateral but likely nonobstructing calculi.\nExtremely echogenic kidneys.\n\n[**2138-1-8**] RUQ US:\nCONCLUSION:\nFindings suggestive mid TIPS stenosis and narrowing, although\nthe TIPS remains patent.\nLarge volume ascites. Small amount of sludge in the gallbladder.\n\n\n[**2137-1-11**] CXR:\nMultifocal consolidations appear unchanged on the right and\nslightly worse on the left. The supporting tubes and lines are\nunremarkable. There is\npotentially slight interval decrease in right pleural effusion,\nalthough it might reflect semi-upright position of the patient\nas opposite to supine with layering of pleural effusions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n49 yo M with h/o MM/plasma cell leukemia which was progressive\ndespite therapy c/b portal HTN of unknown etiology admitted\noriginally with diarrhea and acute renal failure with prolonged\nhospital course complicated by significant RP plasmacytomas,\nTIPS procedure which subsequently stenosed, obstructing left\nureteral stone s/p nephrostomy, respiratory failure requiring\nintubation/ventilation, enterobacter/enterococcus septic shock\nrequiring levophed/vasopressin and renal failure requiring CVVH.\n\n\nUltimately, despite our best efforts, the patient's status\ncontinued to decline.  He was continued on aggressive measures\nup until the end, including pressors, CVVH, and mechanical\nventillation, but he finally succumbed to his illness on\n[**2138-1-12**] at 11:27pm.  He passed away peacefully with family at\nhis bedside.  Please see below for a short summaries of the main\nproblems of his course.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:\n# Septic shock with multi-organ failure: He was intubated on\n[**1-2**] in setting of likely aspiration event and respiratory\ndecompensation and started on pressors for refractory\nhypotension.  He was also on stress dose of steroids at this\ntime. Subsequent blood cultures grew enterobacter and urine grew\nVRE. Both sputum and urine grew yeast, later speciated as\n[**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis. He was treated broadly with meropenem,\ndaptomycin, and micafungin, then changed to linezolid,\ntobramycin, meropenem, and micafungin.  Required vasopressin and\nlevophed to maintain pressures, eventually at max-doses with\ncontinued refractory hypotension resulting in worsening renal\nfailure, respiratory failure, and liver failure.\n\n# Respiratory failure: Intubated [**1-2**] for acute respiratory\nfailure following likely aspiration event.  Sputum had GNRs and\nyeast at the time of enterobacter bacteremia, however then\nconsistently grew [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.  In the final days\nbefore he died, he had increasing requirements on the\nventillator to maintain his sats, and chest xrays showed new\ninfiltrates that were likely due to ongoing aspiration events.\n\n# Renal failure:  found to be in acute renal failure, with\ncreatinine continuing to trend up.  He has a known history of L\nhydronephrosis, and given his worsening liver failure, there was\nalso concern for hepato-renal syndrome.  The patient was being\nseen by hepatology and was s/p TIPS for reduction of portal\npressures.  The patient was maintained on midodrine and\noctreotide initially for hepatorenal syndrome while in the ICU,\nwith doses being titrated up because of no improvement in his\nrenal funciton.  He was also started on albumin, which was\nuptitrated to 100 grams daily.  Because of the evidence of L\nhydronephrosis, the patient also underwent IR procedure and perc\nnephrostomy tube was placed, which initialy drained bloody\nfluid. His BUN/creat ultimately kept climbing, and because of\nhis worsening mental status, he ultimately was started on HD.\nMidodrine and octreotide were stopped at that time. Pt then\ndeveloped sepsis (see above) and was unable to tolerate HD, so\nhe was transitioned to CVVH on [**1-3**]. Given his septic shock, at\nthat point it was thought that there was really no chance of\nrenal recovery, but CVVH was continued per request of the family\nafter discussion of goals of care.  It was continued until the\nday that he passed away.\n\n# Portal hypertension, liver failure: Known to have portal\nhypertension, thought to be secondary to nodular regenerative\nhyperplasia, unclear etiology.  Possibly due to his underlying\nhematologic malignancy.  Patient underwent a TIPs procedure,\nhowever this was found to be partially stenosed on admission the\nICU.  The patient was s/p TIPS on admission to the MICU, and on\nultrasound to evaluate TIPS patency, there was some initial\nevidence of stenosis. He was initially maintained on\nmidodrine/octreotide, however as his sepsis picture worsened,\nthese medications were stopped.  His liver enzymes began to rise\nslightly as septic shock set in, and his labs showed evidence of\nliver failure with decreased synthetic function (namely, an\nelevated INR).\n\n# MM AND PLASMA CELL LYMPHOMA: Pt with refractory disease\ndespite bone marrow transplant and numerous aggressive\ntherapies.  Had been treated with dexamethasone and [**Month/Year (2) **] on\nadmission, however dexamethasone was held when he was placed on\nstress dose steroids.  His [**Month/Year (2) **] was also held.  BMT\ncontinued to follow the patient throughout hospitalization, but\nunfortunately treatment options for his myeloma were exhausted.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nConfirmed with wife on admission\nAtovaquone Suspension 1500 mg PO/NG DAILY after dinner\nMultivitamins 1 TAB\nVitamin D 1000 UNIT PO/NG DAILY  [**12-13**] @ 2134 View\nTestosterone 5mg Patch 1 PTCH TD DAILY  [**12-13**] @ 2134 View\nFoLIC Acid 1 mg PO/NG DAILY  [**12-13**] @ 2134 View\nAcyclovir 400 mg PO/NG Q12H\nPatient has been on this [**Hospital1 **] at home.\nDexamethasone 2 mg po qd\n[**Hospital1 95263**] 10 mg po qod\nOxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg PO/NG Q4H:PRN pain\nChange   DC    Oxycodone SR (OxyconTIN) 10 mg PO Q12H\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nMultiple myeloma\nSepsis\nHypoxemic respiratory failure\nRenal failure\nLiver failure\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nExpired\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nExpired\n\n\n\"\n44899,18737,110846,2135-07-01,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2135-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-7-1**]\n\nDate of Birth:  [**2055-11-16**]             Sex:   F\n\nService: MEDICINE\n\nAllergies:\nCodeine / Lipitor / Fosamax\n\nAttending:[**Doctor First Name 7926**]\nChief Complaint:\nshortness of breath\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\nPICC line placement\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nMs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old lady with pulmonary HTN (on adcirca,\ntyvaso, letairis), CAD s/p stents, HTN, and recent T5 + T8\ncompression fractures, diastolic CHF, and multiple other medical\nproblems who presents because she is feeling unwell and has been\nshort of breath lately.\n.\nShe has been feeling unwell since her discharge from our\nhospital on [**2135-6-7**].

Chest X-ray showed\nlikely atalectasis, no definite pneumonia, but revealed\nworsening of her known vertebral compression fractures since\n[**2134-10-12**]. Her EKG showed evidence of a known inferior\ninfarct, but no ST elevations or depressions or T-wave changes\nto indicate an acute process. Troponins were negative. She was\nfound to have UTI, and urine and blood cultures were sent. Pt\nwas given vancomycin and levofloxacin. Pulmonary was consulted,\nwho felt pt's dyspnea was likely secondary to atalectasis and\nsplinting from her compression fractures, not pneumonia or acute\nworsening of PH, which is typically a more gradual process.\nOrthopedic surgery was consulted, who felt she was not a\ncandidate for kyphoplasty. Her pain was treated with\nacetominophen, tramadol and lidocaine patches PRN. On [**6-25**] she\nreceived one does of morphine sulfate, which she did not\ntolerate well, becoming confused and somnolent. That same day,\nwhile receiving IVFs patient acutely desaturated, not responsive\nto supplemental oxygen. Flash pulmonary edema diagnosed. She was\nalso found to be hypotensive, thought likely secondary to the\nnarcotic dose she had received. She was transferred to the ICU.\n\nThe patient presented to the MICU after triggering of the floor\nfor hypoxia and altered mental status. When the patient arrived,\nshe was somnolent but oriented to person, place, and time. The\npatient appeared volume overloaded with elevated JVD, 3+ pitting\nedema, and diffuse wheezing bilaterally. The patient's protable\nCXR at the time that she triggered on the floor showed interval\nprogression of her pulmonary edema (of note, her diuretics had\nbeen discontinued). The patient also had increased serum\ncreatinine from her baseline. Her constellation of symptoms were\nthought to be due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute\non chronic right heart failure. Because of her low BPs, the\npatient was bolused with IV lasix and started on lasix gtt. The\npatient diuresed well to the lasix gtt. Her volume status,\noxygen requirement, and serum creatinine improved with diuresis.\nOf note, the patient's lasix gtt had to be intermittently\nstopped for SBPs in the 70s-80s. On the AM, prior to transfer to\nthe unit, the patient was noted to have MRSA in her urine. She\nwas continued on Vancomycin for treatment of MRSA bacteruria and\nblood cultures were also drawn. TTE was done that did not show\nevidence of vegetations. The patient was called out to the\nCardiology floor for further diuresis with lasix gtt.\n\nPt was stable on arrival to the cardiology floor, with\nnear-baseline oxygen demand and good urine output. She was taken\noff the lasix drip, and given 60 IV lasix [**Hospital1 **], to match the\ndaily amount she had been receiving continuously. She tolerated\nthis well, and continued to put out good urine with stable\nlytes. She was weaned to PO lasix 60 mg po bid. Letairis was\nalso discontinued per recommendation from pulmonary, who felt it\nmight be contributing to her dyspnea. She was discharged on a\nhigher dose of PO lasix (60 vs. 40 mg po BID), and was advised\nto stop taking letairis. At discharge, pt's weight was 81.6\n(measured late in the day; other weights taken in the early\na.m.), about 2 kg below her admission weight.\n\nOn the day before discharge, her [**Last Name (un) **], which had been held for\nher [**Last Name (un) **], was reinstated at 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], half of her home dose; on\nday of discharge her creatinine bumped to 1.2, and she had\nsystolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s. These episodes were\nasymptomatic, with good mentation and urine output, no chest\npain or increased shortness of breath. For this reason we\ndecreased her [**Last Name (un) **] further to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], and also decreased her\ncarvedilol, which had been increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] during her\ninpatient stay, back to her home dose of 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] on\ndischarge. At discharge she felt at her baseline in terms of\nbreathing and activity, satting in the mid-90s on 4 liters of\nO2.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\nPatient is highly sensitive to fluid balance; She seems to do\nbest at a weight of about 175 lbs, or 80 kg. Going forward, her\nI's and Os should be strictly monitored, with daily weights\ntaken.\n\nPatient is being sent out on bactrim DS for her MRSA UTI, which\nwas culture-proven sensitive to bactrim. She should take one tab\nPO BID, last day [**2135-7-4**]. Of note, patient experiences\nsome nausea with this antibiotic, and should take this pill with\nfood, separate from her other medications to avoid loss of daily\nmeds through emesis.

You were admitted for\nshortness of breath and fatigue. You were found to have a\nurinary tract infection which we treated with antibiotics. You\nwere also found to be breathing less deeply because of back\npain, causing parts of your lungs to inflate less than normal.\nWith increased control of your pain, and use of your incentive\nspirometer, this shortness of breath should improve. Some aspect\nof this shortness of breath may have to do with a medication you\nstarted recently, letairis, which we have discontinued.\n\nYou are being discharged to [**Hospital3 **] center. You\nhave appointments to follow up with your cardiologist's nurse\npractitioner, and with your pulmonologist (see appointments\nbelow).\n\nWe have made some changes to your medications. We increased your\nfurosemide (40 mg to 60 mg twice daily) and decreased your dose\nof losartan (50 mg to 12.5 mg twice daily). You are also being\nsent to rehab with 5 more days of Bactrim, the antibiotic for\nyour MRSA UTI, which you should take through [**7-4**]. Be sure to\nreview the medication reconciliation sheet to see what meds you\nare currently taking.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nYou have the following appointments with your specialists:\n\nWe are working on a follow up appointment in Pulmonary for your\nhospitalization with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Pt's family\nnotes that symptoms began on Friday when he was confused and\nhallucinating. His wife visited him yesterday, and he was\ncomplaining of severe shortness of breath when playing cards.\nNebulizers at that time helped. However, this morning, the\nnursing home called the pt's family, informing them that they\nwere going to send him to the ED.

No evidence of DVT.\n\n[**2173-4-13**] CXR:  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-13**], there\nare continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac\nsilhouette and pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis and\nprobable small pleural effusions. Overall, there is little\nchange from the previous study.\n\n[**2173-4-14**] CXR:  FINDINGS: Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar\natelectasis, left side more than right and small bilateral\npleural effusions are unchanged over past 24 hours.  Mediastinal\ncongestion is also similar. IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema,\nbibasal atelectasis and small pleural\neffusions are unchanged over last 24 hours.\n\n[**2173-4-15**] CXR:  FINDINGS: Compared to the prior radiograph, there\nis now mroe prominent interstitial thickening consistent with\nworsening pulmonary edema. Again seen are small bilateral\npleural effusions, cardiomegaly and retrocardiac opacification,\nlikely atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation or\npneumothorax. Aorta is tortuous.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Worsening moderate pulmonary edema.\n2. Stable bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with a PMH COPD on 2L\nhome oxygen and atrial fibrillation, who was admitted from\nnursing home with fever and hypoxia, who was treated empirically\nfor RLL HCAP with vancomycin and Zosyn. Hospital course was\ncomplicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension,\nrequiring brief MICU stay for closer monitoring.  He then\nexperienced worsening respiratory failure and was made CMO prior\nto discharge with plan for hospice.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient presented with hypoxia\nto 89% on 6L supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. Hypoxia\noccurred in the setting of baseline COPD requiring 2L of home\noxygen. In this circumstance, patient's poor lung function was\nmost likely exacerbated by a possible right lower lobe\npneumonia, noted on CXR but not on CTA. Additionally, x-ray\nimaging showed some evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient was\nevaluated by Speech and Swallow and was determined to have no\novert aspiration. CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nTroponins were negative. The patient was placed on 4L NC, and\ninitially satted in the low to mid-90s. He was temporarily on\nNRB and facemask, during which time he developed afib with RVR\nand hypotension (se below). Pneumonia was treated empirically\nwith vancomycin and Zosyn.  On [**4-13**] he experienced flash\npulmonary edema in response to an episode of agitation and\nhypertension.  His respiratory function continued to be poor\nwith NRB or high-flow face mask requirement despite diuresis and\nantibiotics. This was thought to be due to HCAP, likely\npost-obstructive, combined with flash pulmonary edema and\nunderlying COPD. He was not able to cough, and therefore was\nunable to clear any infectious component. His prognosis was\nthought to be poor given his lack of response to treatment and\nprogressive respiratory decline.  After transitioning to\ninpatient hospice, the patient continued ipratropium nebulizers\nas needed for comfort. He used a highflow facemask for\nsupplemental oxygen. Episodes of respiratory distress were\ntreated with morphine and lorzepam as needed. The patient\nultimately expired, with primary cause of death respiratory\nfailure.\n\n# Fever: Low grade fever prior to admission and in ED was\nattributed to possible RLL PNA. One set of BCx's did grow CONS,\nbut this was probably a contaminant. Other cultures returned\nnegative. As above, CTA was negative for PE. Patient was treated\nempirically with vanc/Zosyn.  This was switched to an oral\nregimen with Augmentin and azithromycin on [**4-14**]; antibiotics\nwere continued until decision was made to pursue comfort-focused\ncare.\n\n# Afib: Patient had been well-controlled on digoxin and atenolol\nfor afib in the past. However, he developed RVR with rates up to\n200. An acute episode was controlled with metoprolol tartrate 5\nmg IV x3, diltiazem 5 mg IV x2 and metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO\nx1, with subsequent return of rate to low 100s. Trigger for afib\nwith RVR was likely multifactorial from systemic stress of\ninfection, volume overload and possible hypercarbia. Patient was\nasymptomatic during this episode. He was then started on\nmetoprolol tartrate with good rate control.  This was later held\nfor a day due to hypotensive episode on HD3, then restarted to\navoid Afib with RVR and subsequent flashing.\n\n# Hypotension: On HD3, after receiving beta blockers and calcium\nchannel blockers for rate control, patient developed hypotension\nto SBPs in the 70s-80s. This was most likely secondary to\nmedication effects and volume overload with relative\nintravascular repletion. Differential also included pulmonary\nembolism, myocardial infarction, sepsis and hypovolemia. LLE\nDoppler was negative for DVT. EKG without any acute changes.\nPatient appeared euvolemic on exam, but exhibited pulmonary\nedema on CXR. He was transferred to the MICU for further\nmanagement and closer monitoring.  His anti-hypertensive\nmedication was held and his BP returned to [**Location 213**] levels.\n\n# Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count now downtrended to 78 at its\nnadir, but had values in the low 100s (113, 134) in [**6-/2172**] as\nwell. Unclear what pt's baseline is. No obvious signs of\nbleeding. Other possible etiology is possible MDS. LFTs were\nnormal.\n\n# AMS The patient experienced some delirium with reduced\norientation.  This was most likely due to pneumonia and\nrespiratory distress.  He had baseline dementia.\n\n# ARF.  Increased creatinine from 1.0 to 1.3 on MICU admission,\nreturned to baseline 1.1.  Likely result of poor forward flow in\nthe setting of AF with RVR and may have pre-renal given poor po\nintake, elevated BUN.\n\n# AF.  Controlled with metoprolol and digoxin.  Metoprolol was\nbriefly held for hypotension.  Has CHADS at least 2, but not\nanticoagulated, likely due to history of falls.\n\n# Lung mass.  Incidental finding on CT chest. This was not\nformally discussed with the patient or his family.  They prefer\nto focus on comfort.\n\n# Goals of care:  The patient's respiratory status continued to\ndegrade despite antibiotics and diuresis.  He was uncomfortable\non turning and dyspnic with mild exertion.  The patient and\nfamily were against intubation.  He was maintained on\nnon-rebreather and high-flow face mask with some episodes of\ndyspnea and shortness of breath.  These were managed with\nmorphine IV and then PO.  The Palliative Care team was consulted\nfor assistance with symptom management.  A family meeting was\nheld on [**4-15**] during which time the patient's poor prognosis was\nreviewed.  They chose to focus on comfort measures and hospice\nplacement.  Antibiotics and most medications were discontinued.\nHospice care was continued on the medical floor, and he died\ncomfortably.\n.\nTRANSIIONAL ISSUES:\nN/A\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. tamsulosin 0.4 mg Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr Sig: One (1)\nCapsule, Ext Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).\n2. citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n3. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose Disk with Device Sig:\nOne (1) puff Inhalation [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).\n4. pravastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at\nbedtime).\n5. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n6. atenolol 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n7. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig:\nOne (1) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Topical DAILY (Daily).\n8. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Two (2) ML PO BID (2 times\n\na day).\n9. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: [**12-21**] Tablet PO Q6H (every 6\nhours) as needed for pain.\n10. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H\n(every 6 hours).\n11. furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n12.

There was also gastric mucocele metaplasia.\n\nCT of the abdomen indicated a 10 by 6.0 centimeter soft\ntissue mass within the mesentery just below the pelvic rim as\nwell as a 10 by 16 centimeter mesenteric and retroperitoneal\nhematoma displaying the duodenum anteriorly and compressing\nthe inferior vena cava.  Significant mesenteric\nlymphadenopathy was also noted.\n\nRenal and surgery services were consulted.  On the\nrecommendation of the surgery service, a follow-up abdominal\nCT with p.o. contrast was completed which indicated\npersistent intra-abdominal hematoma but no intra-abdominal\nmass.  The patient was also now noted to have increased liver\nfunction tests with an ALT of 622, AST of 649, and normal\ntotal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.\n\nAs the patient's hematocrit continued to drop, a bleeding\nscan was conducted which indicated active bleeding into the\nabdomen with no clear source.  The patient therefore received\nan angiogram which indicated the presence of a superior\nmesenteric artery aneurysm as well as active bleeding from\nthe gastroduodenal artery which was embolized.\n\nThe patient also developed shortness of breath following the\nadministration of a total of fourteen units of packed red\nblood cells in the Intensive Care Unit.  Chest x-ray\nindicated the presence of congestive heart failure and a\npossible left sided infiltrate.  The patient was started on\nLasix as well as Levaquin and Flagyl.  A hepatitis panel was\nsent which was negative.  ANCA was sent out of concern over\npossible polyarteritis nodosa, however, this study was\nnegative.  The patient was also started on total parenteral\nnutrition secondary to an expected ileus following\nembolization.\n\nWhile in the Intensive Care Unit following embolization, his\ntransaminases trended downward, and his creatinine improved,\nand his hematocrit remained stable.  The patient did develop\ntransient episodic hypertension to a systolic pressure of 200\nrequiring Labetalol drip, however, this was successfully\nweaned and the patient was transitioned to Labetalol tablets.\nWhile in the unit, he also developed bipedal and scrotal\nedema, which again was thought secondary to volume overload\nin the setting of multiple transfusions.\n\nEchocardiogram conducted on hospital day number four\nindicated ejection fraction of greater than 55% with 1+\ntricuspid regurgitation.\n\nOn hospital day number six, the patient was transferred to\nthe floor for additional workup of questionable abdominal\nmass.  On repeat [**Location (un) 1131**] of the patient's existing CAT scans,\nit was determined that what was initially read as a mass on\nthe first CT was likely to be extension of the hematoma.\nFollow-up imaging in four weeks was recommended.\n\nOn his first day on the floor, the patient spiked a\ntemperature to 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  Repeat chest x-ray\nindicated worsening pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally. At\nthis point, the patient was switched to Ceftazidime and\nClindamycin to treat possible nosocomial pneumonia.  Sputum\nand blood cultures were sent which were negative.\n\nThe patient's pulmonary status improved significantly on\nintravenous antibiotics.  As the patient was able to tolerate\np.o. intake, his total parenteral nutrition was discontinued.\nHowever, the patient noted some pain with eating and was\nfound to have a small lesion at the site of his denture\ninsertion site.  The patient was able to tolerate food after\npretreatment with Viscous Lidocaine solution.\n\nAlthough the patient's initial abdominal pain subsided, he\nwas maintained on Oxycontin for control of residual abdominal\npain while on the floor.  The patient's lower extremity edema\ndecreased with the administration of intravenous and then\nsubsequently p.o. Lasix.\n\nOn hospital day number ten, the patient was noted to have\nincreasing jaundice and altered mental status.  Liver\nfunction tests at that time indicated an alkaline phosphatase\nof 1091 and total bilirubin of 11.4.  His transaminases were\nonly slightly elevated.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound\nwas performed which indicated a dilatation of the common bile\nduct as well as the presence of biliary sludge.  There was no\nintrahepatic biliary duct dilatation and no gallstones.\n\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed\nafter consultation with the gastroenterology service.  This\nstudy indicated a fifteen millimeter common bile duct which\nwas stented as well as stenosis of the distal bulb.  The\npatient's liver function tests, jaundice and mental status\nimproved following endoscopic retrograde\ncholangiopancreatography.  The patient was to have a\nfollow-up endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in\nthree months for stent removal.\n\nAlthough the patient's mental status did improve following\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, some residual\nsymptoms of agitation and paranoia prompted a psychiatry\nconsultation who recommended low dose of Haldol p.r.n. for\nworsening of these symptoms.  However, the patient's mental\nstatus slowly returned to his baseline.\n\nThe patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service who\nfound that he would benefit from acute rehabilitation.  At\nthe time of this discharge summary, the patient was being\nscreened for placement in an acute rehabilitation facility.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Superior mesenteric artery aneurysm.\n2.

He was found to\nhave epitaxis with integrilin and ENT was consulted, nose was\npacked and no further occurence with intergrilin stopping.  Was\nalso noted to have hematoma at left hip and orthopedic surgery\nwas consulted, it remained stable, required no surgical\nintervention and no evidence of sciatic nerve dysfunction. He\nunderwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated extensive\nthree vessel disease as well as aortic stenosis. He underwent\nsurgical evaluation for cardiac surgery.  On [**2114-3-16**] he was\nbrought to the operating room and underwent coronary artery\nbypass graft surgery and aortic valve replacement.  See\noperative report for further details.  He received vancomycin\nfor perioperative antibiotics.  He was transferred to the\nintensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.  He required\ninotropes due to systolic heart failure but were weaned off in\nthe first twenty four hours postoperatively.  He was also weaned\nfrom sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated.\nHe remained in the intensive care unit for hemodynamic\nmonitoring, and had atrial fibrillation post operative day one\nat night, treated with betablockers and amidarone which after a\nfew hours converted to normal sinus rhythm.  He was transferred\nto the floor for the remainder of his care.  He had intermittent\nepisodes of atrial fibrillation and was started on coumadin for\nanticoagulation.  On post-operative day three he was found to\nhave a right forearm phlebitis.  Further, there was a small\namount of sero-sanguinous drainage from his mediastinal\nincision.  He was placed on Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.  On\nthe following day the sternal drainage abated.  The forearm had\nimproved, but because Mr. [**Known lastname 81021**] has a new aortic valve, a\nPICC was placed and a plan was set for 2 weeks of IV Vancomycin\nand oral ciprofloxacin.

Vancomycin via her jtube was started. Her WBC\nbegan to rise and she spiked a fever on [**3-15**]. She was found to\nbe more distended and had emesis. On [**3-17**] A CT abd/pelvis was\nobtained and she was found to have an anastomotic leak. Thus,\nshe was sent to IR for placement of a catheter drain. This was\nplaced into her mediastinal fluid collection. She was also\nstarted on IV vanco/zosyn and continued her treatment for\nC.diff. She was made NPO.\n\nOn [**3-17**] she was started on fluconazole because her fluid\ncollection grew yeast.\nOn [**3-20**] a PICC line was placed.\nOn [**3-22**] she was found to have elevated LFTs and a RUQ u/s was\nobtained.

A geriatric consult\nwas initiated and she was started on Celexa and ritalin for\ndepression. Her depression mildly improved prior to discharge.\non [**3-26**] her tube feeds were changed to a more concentrated\nformula to help correct her mild hyponatremia.\non [**3-28**] she had a repeat UGI study showing no leak. She was\nstarted on a sips diet.\non [**3-29**] she started clear liquids\non [**3-30**] she started and tolerated a softs diet\nOn [**3-31**] she was discharged to a rehab facility. her picc line\nwas removed prior to discharge.\n\nPhysical Therapy worked with the patient daily, however she was\nvery reluctant to cooperate. Often, she refused to work with\nthem. PT did feel that she was capable of working with her\nphysically, but her reluctance limited her activity.\n\nUTI/Urinary Incontinence/Urgency: The patient was often\nincontinent to urine secondary to increased urgency.

There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and\nregional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler\nimaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure\n(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,\nascending and arch levels are normal. The number of aortic valve\nleaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened (?#). No masses or vegetations are seen on the\naortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal\nimage quality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or\nvegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully\nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen.

The tip projects\nover the\nproximal part of the stomach. On the displayed parts of the\nthorax there is\nno evidence of visible complications.\n\nCXR [**4-23**]\nFINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff\ncatheter has\nbeen replaced by a nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube appears\nto project\nover the distal parts of the stomach. However, the tube is\ncoiled in the\nstomach. Normal course of the tube, no evidence of\ncomplications. Otherwise,\nthe radiograph is unchanged.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78102**] is an 84-year-old man with a history of\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM and previous stroke who\npresents with changes in mental status and evidence of new\nstroke. Patient has new head CT with signs of acute RMCA stroke,\nnow bilateral disease.  In the initial evaluation, the patient\nwas very confused and disoriented, and concerning for possible\nnon-convulsive status epilepticus.  He received Ativan 1 mg IV\nand had a further deterioration of his mental status.  The\npatient was then intubated for airway protection and admitted to\nthe neuro ICU.\n.\nHospital course by problem;\n.\nNeuro; The patient was admitted to the neurological ICU after\nintubation in the Emergency Department.  His home aspirin was\ndiscontinued and he was started on plavix.  Given his\ndisorientation and somnolence, he was initially started on\nkeppra, however this was discontinued the following morning as\nhis bilateral hemispheric disease from strokes were thought to\naccount for his change in mental status.   His blood pressure\nwas allowed to autoregulate for the first 48 hours after the\nevent.  A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no cardiac source\nfor his stroke.  The patient's LDL was 74 and HbA1c was 5.6.  He\nwas continued on a statin and fingersticks were covered with\nregular insulin sliding scale.  He underwent an MRI brain and\nMRA of his head and neck.  The MRI brain confirmed the right\nparietal subacute infarct, however also appeared suspicious for\npossible acute infarct in the left parietal lobe in the region\nof his prior stroke in [**2139**], as this region was also bright on\nDWI and dark on ADC.  This remains somewhat uncertain as the\narea of infarct appears unchanged when comparing to his imaging\nin [**2139**], although MRI sequences do reveal the concern for\npossible bilateral acute strokes.  An MRA of the head and neck\nwas notable for moderate to high-grade narrowing at the origin\nof the right ICA, although degree of stenosis was difficult to\nquantify.  Therefore, the patient underwent CTA head and neck\nwhich showed 30-40% stenosis at the origin of right internal\ncarotid artery, which was considered mild , and it did not show\nevidence of any other abnormality. A transesophageal\nechocardiogram was attempted which could not be completed owing\nto parapharyngeal mass. His examination is notable for\ninattention, fluent empty non meaningful speech, moving all\nextermities antigravity.\n.\nRespiratory; The patient was extubated on HD#2 after receiving\nhis MRI/A. he was maintaining good saturation on oxygen mask\nafter transfer from ICU to floor.\n.\nID; The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection on\n[**4-17**] and was started on ciprofloxacin.  A urine culture was\nsterile. He was given cipro for 7 days.\n.\nCV; The patient was continued on his beta blocker at 1/4 his\nhome dose to allow for permissive hypertension in the acute\nsetting of stroke and as he was bradycardic on telemetry with a\nheart rate in the 50s-60s.  This can be titrated up to his home\ndose of atenolol 100 mg daily as tolerated. He was in atrial\nfibrillation, with controlled rate. Heparin or coumadin was not\nstarted immdiately because of concerns for hemorrhagic\ntransformation. he was started on his home meds in stepwise\nfashion keeping a watch over his blood pressure.\n.\nGU; The patient had hematuria upon arrival to the ICU.  This was\nthought to be secondary to traumatic foley placement.  This\nresponded to irrigation and his hematocrit remained relatively\nstable.\n.\nEndo; The patient was continued on his glipizide and\nfingersticks were treated with regular insulin sliding scale.\n\nENT; patient was noted to have parapharyngeal mass for which ENT\nconsult was sought. They felt that this does not require urgent\nwork up and does not pose contraindication for anticoagulation,\nshould felt necessary for other reasons.\n\nNutrition\nHe was evaluated by nutrition team. he was encouraged to\nincrease PO intake and to undergo calorie count. It was felt\nthat he would require PEG tube. He got PEG tube on [**4-25**], and\nfeeds were started.\n.\nGoals of care; Unfortunately, the patient's wife passed away one\nyear ago and he has no known family.  His health care proxy is\nhis sister-in-law, [**Name (NI) 78103**] [**Name (NI) 27598**].  She was frequently contact[**Name (NI) **] and\nthe goals of care were discussed on regular basis.

His brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 13304**],\nlives in [**Name (NI) 3844**] and checks in with the patient\nperiodically.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unknown.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure of\n90/45, temperature maximum 102.4, heart rate 96 to 110,\nrespiratory rate 16 to 21, oxygen saturation 95 to 98% on\n\"\"many\"\" liters of oxygen.  General - The patient is not responsive\nbut moving in athetotic pattern.  Skin - multiple abrasions on\nbilateral lower extremities (DIP of all toes, lateral malleoli\nand dorsum of feet).  No petechiae.  No jaundice.  Head, eyes,\nears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are 2.0\nmillimeters and reactive bilaterally. Unable to assess\nextraocular movements.  Bilateral periorbital erythema and edema.\nRight eye with subconjunctival hemorrhage superior to pupil.  No\nBattle sign.  Respiratory is clear to auscultation anteriorly.\nExamination limited due to the patient's unresponsiveness.\nCardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or\ngallops.  Abdomen is soft, normoactive bowel sounds, nontender,\nnondistended, no organomegaly.  Extremities - no cyanosis,\nclubbing or edema, pulses 2+ bilaterally. Abrasions on lateral\nmalleoli bilaterally and dorsum of feet. Rectal is guaiac\nnegative.  Neurologically, the patient is moving all four\nextremities, withdraws to pain, no posturing, no corneal or gag\nreflex (but on Propofol).  Toes downgoing.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 17.6, hematocrit\n34.3, platelets 364,000, neutrophils 71%, bands 18%, lymphocytes\n6%.  Urinalysis is nitrite positive, protein trace, bilirubin\nsmall, pH 5.0, blood negative, red blood cells 0 per high power\nfield, white blood cells 0-2 per high power field, bacteria rare.\nChem7 revealed sodium 141, potassium 4.4, chloride 105,\nbicarbonate 13, blood urea nitrogen 56, creatinine 4.2, glucose\n100, anion gap 23.  CPK [**Numeric Identifier 40281**], MB 91, index 0.8.  Toxicology\nscreen - Aspirin negative, ETOH negative, Tylenol negative,\nbenzodiazepines negative, barbiturates negative, TCAs negative.\nCarbamazepine 33 ([**3-18**]).\n\nElectrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR interval\n204 consistent with first degree AV block, left atrial\nenlargement, QRS 140, Q-Tc 450, peaked T waves, 1.0 to 2.[**Street Address(2) 27948**] elevation in V1, V2, but pattern is left bundle\nbranch block, no T wave inversions, Q wave only in lead III.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  CT of the head revealed cerebellar atrophy,\nmucosal thickening of maxillary and ethmoid sinus.  CT spine\nrevealed normal alignment of vertebra, no fractures, no\nsubluxation, positive degenerative changes in C4-C5, C5-C6,\nC6-C7.  Chest x-ray revealed hazy opacities in the bilateral\napices and right lower lobe - ? aspiration.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Toxicology - The patient was noted to have elevated\nCarbamazepine levels.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from toxicology\nrecommended charcoal for absorption of the toxin. Carbamazepine\nlevels were monitored q3hours.  Activated charcoal 30 grams were\ngiven at the time of arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nand three hours afterwards and need for further doses was\nevaluated in the a.m. after admission.  The patient most likely\nhad a Carbamazepine overdose (question intentional or confused\nor due to interaction with fluconazole, recently begun for\ncandidiasis). The levels were reduced to therapeutic range with\ncharcoal treatment and intravenous hydration.  They were\nmonitored for a couple days after that, however, remained in\nnormal limits for the duration of the hospital course.\n\n2.  Cardiology - The patient had a new widening of the QRS on\ninitial electrocardiogram and this was likely related to sodium\nchannel blocking activity of Tegretol.  One amp of bicarbonate\nwas pushed and the electrocardiogram was rechecked.  QRS\nprolongation resolved rapidly after the bicarbonate and\nresolution of the patient's acidemia.\n\n3.  Pulmonary - Due to the patient's findings on chest x-ray\nof right lower lobe and bilateral apical opacities, he was\nassumed to have suffered an aspiration event causing aspiration\npneumonia.  He was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg intravenously\nq.d. and Clindamycin 300 mg t.i.d. intravenously which was\ncontinued for fourteen days.  While in the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit, he was kept on the ventilator with full support, however,\nonce he improved, on [**2100-11-8**], he was extubated.  No\ncomplications after extubation.  The Levofloxacin and Clindamycin\nwere continued for a fourteen day course and discontinued\nstarting on [**2100-11-17**].  The patient's lung findings improved\nrapidly over the course of the stay and for the last six days he\nwas clear to auscultation bilaterally with normal oxygen\nsaturation and no signs or symptoms, i.e., cough.\n\n4.  Renal - Initially the patient's creatinine was increased to\n4.2.  He also had elevated creatinine kinase enzyme levels around\n10,000.  This was most likely rhabdomyolysis and resolved with\nhydration and bicarbonate and eventually the CKs trended\ndownward.  The elevated creatinine normalized within the first\ncouple of days around [**2100-11-4**], and was postulated to be due to\nacute renal failure secondary to severe hydration.  His decreased\npotassium was also suspected to be secondary to diarrhea,\ngastrointestinal losses.\n\n5.  Gastrointestinal - His recent gastrointestinal bleed at [**Hospital 14852**] secondary to erosive esophagitis prompted\nnasogastric tube lavage on admission in the Emergency Department\nwhich was clear.  He was treated with intravenous Protonix for\nthe duration of his hospital course up until discharge.  Multiple\nClostridium difficile toxin assays were sent which were negative.\nHis abdominal examination continued to appear benign.\n\n6.  Neurology - The patient's altered mental status was likely\nsecondary to the Tegretol overdose.  His CT of the head was\nnegative for any acute process.  Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for\nHSV and urine toxicology screens were negative, not consistent\nwith these as possible etiologies of altered mental status.  The\npatient was also while intubated on Propofol and thus not\nallowing assessment of his current mental status.  A few days\nlater, a CT was done of the head again which showed minimal\nintraventricular and subarachnoid blood.\n\nNeurology recommendations included electroencephalogram and\nmagnetic resonance scan to further workup altered mental status.\nTwo lumbar punctures were also done, one at admission and one\nlater on.  Both were bloody with increased protein, however, CT\nof the head initially did not reveal an acute bleed.  The repeat\nCT on [**2100-11-4**], is stated above. Neurology did not feel that\nthese were large enough to be treated and thus would resolve on\ntheir own.  Follow-up CT will need to be obtained one week after\ndischarge.\n\n7.  Hematology - The patient's hematocrit was 34.3 on admission\nand dropped to 26.7 on hospital day number one.  He was\ntransfused with two units after which his hematocrit remained\nstable for the duration of the admission.\n\n8.  Trauma - He was seen by trauma surgery to be evaluated for\ncervical spine instability; they recommended that he be kept in a\ncervical collar even though he had no fracture, since ligamentous\ninjury was not ruled out at the time. Later on in the course of\nthe hospitalization when he was moved to the floor, flexion and\nextension spine films were done and approved by neurosurgery as\nclear and thus the collar was removed.  He will follow-up with\nneurosurgery a week or two after discharge when he will be\nreevaluated with flexion and extension films as well as a head CT\nto follow his subarachnoid blood and intraventricular blood seen\non CT of the head on [**2100-11-4**].\n\n9.  Dermatology - The patient was also seen by dermatology while\nin the Medical Intensive Care Unit for his multiple abrasions on\nbilateral malleoli and forehead.  Initially, it was felt that\nthese may be trauma induced erosions versus herpetic erosions.\nDFA for HSV type I and type II as well as ZBZ were negative\nexcept for an HSV type I DFA which was positive.  All other\ncultures of the wound were negative and Acyclovir, which was\nstarted empirically when dermatology first saw him for HSV, was\ndiscontinued when these cultures and DFA came back negative.\nThese abrasions were treated with Bacitracin Ointment and wound\ndressing changes b.i.d.\n\n10. Psychiatry - While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the\npatient was also seen by psychiatry who was unable to fully\nevaluate him while he was sedated.  They recommended an\nelectroencephalogram and magnetic resonance scan to evaluate\nmental status if this did not improve once he was extubated.\nThey also were questioning the fact that his Carbamazepine\nlevel of 33 implied overingestion, suggesting possible assault or\npossible suicide attempt.  The hypothesis that was generated was\nthat perhaps the patient had a seizure and overdosed with\nTegretol during postictal confusion.\n\nLater on in the hospitalization, they revisited the patient when\nhe was alert, awake and oriented.  The patient disclosed that he\nhad had a seizure on the day of admission.  He did not know\nanything about the overingestion of the Tegretol, however, he did\ndeny assault or suicidal attempts.  At the time of discharge, the\npatient was not considered to have any psychiatric issues as he\nwas cheerful and responsive to questions.  The psychiatry team\nfelt that it was reasonable that he was going to be discharged to\na temporary rehabilitation facility prior to returning home to\ncare for himself.\n\n11. Hospital floor course - The patient was extubated on\n[**2100-11-8**], and moved to the floor on [**2100-11-9**]. His respiratory\nstatus was stable and oxygen was in the process of being weaned.\nHis issues of Tegretol overdose as well as rhabdomyolysis were\nresolved and levels of Tegretol as well as CKs were trending\ndownward towards normal limits.\n\nAs aspiration pneumonia continued to be treated with Levofloxacin\nand Clindamycin for a fourteen day course.  The patient continued\nto improve respiratory wise with good oxygen saturation, good\nrespiratory rate and clear lung examination.\n\nNeurology: he had a repeat head CT done on the day of transfer\nfrom the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor which was not\ndifferent from the [**2100-11-4**] study and was notable for perhaps a\nslightly larger bleed (\"\"subdural fluid collection\"\").  It was\ndecided that a repeat CT would be done one to two weeks after\ndischarge when following up with neurosurgery unless there was\nsignificant clinical deterioration.  During his continued\nhospital course, he had no neurological deficits, no signs of\ncentral nervous system infection.  Magnetic resonance scan and\nelectroencephalogram were postponed as the patient's mental\nstatus continued to improve progressively and once he was awake,\nwas alert and oriented times three.\n\nEventually as stated previously, his cervical collar was removed\nonce he was clinically cleared with extension and flexion\ncervical spine films.\n\nHe was continued on Lopresor 100 mg b.i.d. for his hypertension\nand was switched to Atenolol 100 mg q.d. on discharge.\n\nNutrition - The patient had a nasogastric tube in since the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit stay and due to aspiration pneumonia\nhistory as well as neck instability, tube feeds were started on\nthis patient two days after he reached the floor in efforts to\ngive him nutrition.  Swallow specialist was consulted.  For the\nfirst couple of days, he failed the swallow studies with signs\nand symptoms of aspiration upon taking thin liquids. Eventually,\nhe did better with liquids and was started on soft solids and\nthick liquids. This continued to be his diet upon discharge.  He\nremains on aspiration precautions.\n\nHis hematocrit remained stable during his hospital floor course\nand his abrasions on his extremities continued to be treated with\nBacitracin Ointment application to the wounds with dressing\nchanges twice a day.\n\nOf note, the patient's brother visited him once during his\nMedical Intensive Care Unit stay at which time he was unable to\ntalk to the patient.  His brother visited one more time while he\nwas on the floor.  He described the patient was slowly returning\nto his baseline and at baseline the patient talks and is fully\nfunctional, transports himself around the city, and is very\nmeticulous about his medication regimen by taking the right\namount at the right time, never over or under.\n\nDISPOSITION:  To subacute/acute rehabilitation facility until\nfunction returns to baseline.

Still awaiting decision if f/u colonoscopy\nis warranted given pt HX with the prep. Pt was given senna and\nhad 200 cc melena over night on [**8-12**]. Pt had not had bowel\nmovement since GI prep; this could just be residual blood from\ninitial GIB/. Repeat colonoscopy was decided against due to pts\npresent state\n\n.\n2. Delirium: Pt has remained in a confused state  for the past 4\ndays. He has been placed in restraints due to threatening\nbehavior and trying to pull at tubes. MS change has been\nimproving. He remains confused. He is responsive to voice and\ntactile stimulation. Pt is mumbling but beginning to make more\nsense. Concern remains what MS change is due to. Infectious work\nup is in process. Began pt on olanzapine as per geriatric\nconsult. Pt had a run of SVT over the night on [**8-7**] but was\neasily arousable. NO concern felt. ON [**8-8**], pt was conversing.\nHe appeared to be returning to his original state. Foley was d/c\nand ucx and BCX taken. ucx was negative. UA obtained showed some\nbacteria and WBC. That evening, Foley replaced due to lack of\noutput. Pt became combative and was given olanzapine. On rounds\non [**8-9**], pt unarousable. Tried to arouse him with multiple\nstimuli with little response.  Suction was used to remove sputum\nand fluid accumulating in his throat and mouth. Pt was\nresponsive to this measure. His eyes would bunch up and he tried\nto block the suction.   His blood pressure decreased to 90/60.\nBut then returned between 118-120 and then increased to 130/85.\nCXR showed Left retrocardiac opacity. Pt afternoon, pt\nresponsive and more alert. D/c haldol and olanzapine. If\ncombative, pt will be placed in restraints. Trying to have\npatient come off the past medications. On [**8-9**], began Levaquin\ndue to CXR showing possible aspiration pneumonia and a possible\nUTI as shown by UA. These are both possible causes for patients\ncurrent state. Marked improvement noted on [**8-10**]. Pt became more\nresponsive and was able to tell the story of how he ended up in\nthe hospital. SPS consulted again for evaluation. Vanco was d/c\nas blood CX on [**8-3**] showed that bacteria was susceptible to\noxacillin.\n-Bacteremia seems to be the cause of the delirium\n\nPt given trazodone and lodaxaprine on the night of [**8-10**].

Angiography revealed a right dominant\nsystem with 50% distal left main lesion; 70% ostial stenosis in\nthe left anterior descending; 90% stenosis in the circumflex\ninvolving the first obtuse marginal; and 70% lesion in the mid\nright coronary artery. Ventriculography showed only trace mitral\nregurgitations with an LVEF around 50%. Based on the above\nresults, cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation\nwas performed. A preoperative chest x-ray was notable for a new\nright lower lobe opacity which will require further evaluation\nas an outpatient. Workup was otherwise unremarkable and he was\ncleared for surgery.\n\nOn [**2174-9-29**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed three vessel coronary artery\nbypass grafting. This operation was performed off pump. Surgery\nwas uneventful and he transferred to the CSRU in stable\ncondition. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and\nwas extubated without incident. He required diuresis and\naggressive chest PT while steroid therapy was resumed. Serial\nchest x-rays were notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the left\nhemithorax with a small left apical pneumothorax. He otherwise\nmaintained stable hemodynamics and eventually transferred to the\nSDU. Steroid therapy was gradually tapered. He remained afebrile\nbut was empirically started on antibiotics for positive sputum\nculture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Postoperatively, he was\nnoted to have a persistent leukocytosis - most likely\nsteroid-induced. Beta blockade was slowly advanced as tolerated.\nHe remained in a normal sinus rhythm. At discharge, his apical\npneumothorax remained stable while oxygen saturations remained\n96% on 3L. Over several days, he worked with physical therapy\nand continued to make clinical improvements. Medical therapy was\noptimized and he was eventually cleared for rehab on\npostoperative day seven. He will need to complete his\nantibiotics at rehab and continue to require several more days\nof gentle diuresis. He will eventually need to follow up with\nhis pulmonologist and require outpatient CT scan to further\nevaluate his new right lower lobe lung opacity.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAspirin, Plavix, Toprol XL, Zocor 20 qd, Decadron, Theophylline,\nSingulair, Protonix, Flomax, Claritin, Serax, Effexor,\nWellbutrin, Pamelor, Atrovent, Albuterol, Xopenex\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

A chest x-ray was\nperformed and did not show evidence of infection or fluid\noverload. She had a normal EKG. Three sets of cardiac enzymes\nwere checked and were normal. Initially she was placed on\ntelemetry, given aspirin 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg, and started\non metoprolol due to concern for an ischemic event in the\nsetting of ERCP. When her enzymes were negative, these were\ndiscontinued.\n.\nOver the course of the next day, she was noted to have a\nleukocytosis, and a fever, as well as hypoxia, concerning for an\naspiration event. She was started on levofloxacin and\nmetronidazole. Sputum and blood cultures were ordered. A speech\nand swallow consult was placed and recommended thickened liquids\nand ground solids, as well as 1:1 supervision with meals. Blood\ncultures grew GPC in pairs and chains, and vancomycin was\nstarted. Serial blood cultures were ordered and showed gram\nnegative rods.\n.\nShe had chronic diastolic heart failure during her stay. She was\ninitially given a dose of 20 mg IV lasix for possible fluid\noverload related to her ERCP, but was noted to be fairly\neuvolumic with no evidnece of fluid overload on exam, and was\ntransitioned to lasix 40 mg twice daily per her home dose. She\nhad daily I/Os, daily weights. She was continued on aspirin, a\nbeta-blocker, and a statin, as well as lisinopril.\n.\nFor her cholangiocarcinoma with malignant stricture, she is s/p\nstent exchange. For her diabetes, her glipizide was held\ninpatient, and she was continued on insulin sliding scale. She\nwas continued on her home medications for Parkinson's disease.\n\n.\nShe was DNR/DNI during her stay, confirmed with her and her\nhusband.\n\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] update:\nIn the morning of [**2168-9-20**] the hospitalist was called to assess\nthe patient for acute onset shortness of breath and hypoxia.\nPer his note her SpO2 was initially 55% which improved to 75% on\na non-rebreather.  The patient was noted to be rigoring and\nuncomfortable.  Of note the patient has parkinson's disease and\nit was difficult to obtain an accurate finger oximetry. Her\nblood pressure was measured at 230/60 and her respiratory rate\nwas 44. She received an albuterol nebulizer threatment and her\noxygen saturations improved to 98% on 4L NC but she remained\ntachypneic in the 30s.  ABG performed during the trigger was\n7.45/37/108.  Stat portable CXR was unchanged from priors.  She\nwas transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.\n.\nOn review of systems she notes feeling chilled and continues to\nhave shortness of breath.  She denies fevers, chest pain,\nnausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain\nor swelling.  She has not had a recurrence of the chest pain she\nexperienced on the night of admission.\n\nPatient underwent CTA which showed no evidence of PE on CT scan,\nno evidence of pna. Presumed shortness of breath was thought to\nbe secondary to bacteremia - grew out gram negative rods in\nblood which grew while on levofloxacin with increasing WBC, most\nlikely biliary stent is the etiology.

Stool was brown and guaiac-positive.\nLabs were notable for WBC 2.7, Hct 31.7, Plt 110, INR 1.0, Cr\n0.8, ALT 43, EtOH 141, lactate 3.2 (downtrending to 2.9). CT of\nthe head and neck were negative for acute injuries. However, the\npatient's C-spine could not be cleared due to pain to palpation\nat C5-6, so he remained in a C-collar. CT abdomen/pelvis showed\nmassive splenomegaly, circumferential bladder wall thickening,\npancreatic calcifications, extensive colonic diverticulosis,\nright renal cyst, no acute process. CXR showed no acute\ncardiopulmonary process. Left shoulder films were negative for\nfracture or dislocation. EKG NSR without ischemic changes.\n.\nIn the ED, 16- and 18-gauge peripheral IVs were placed. The\npatient was given 3 L NS, ativan 1 mg IV x 3, dilaudid 0.5 mg IV\nx 1, zofran 4 mg IV x 2. He was bolused with 40 mg of IV\nprotonix, and started on a protonix gtt. NG lavage was not\nperformed. GI was consulted and recommended protonix and\noctreotide gtt, anesthesia consult for EGD given C-collar. The\npatient was admitted to the MICU due to concern about CIWA\nscores as high as 30 ([**Doctor Last Name **] [**1-24**] on transfer). GI also\npreferred to scope the patient in the ICU due to the present of\nthe C-collar. On transfer, the patient was afebrile with HR 84,\nRR 20, BP 122/90, Sat 99%/RA.\n.\nOn arrival to the ICU, the patient's only complaint was left\nshoulder pain. He says he had some lightheadedness earlier which\nhas improved but is still present.\n.\nReview of systems: Denies fever, chills. +cough, sore throat\nduring past 3 days. No chest pain.

History suggestive of upper GIB, particularly\nin the setting of heavy NSAID use. The differential on admission\nincluded gastritis/PUD, variceal bleeding in the setting of\npossible cirrhosis, [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear. His hematocrit has been\nstable at 28, and probably at patient's baseline, arguing\nagainst large bleed. He was maintained NPO, two large bore IV's\nwere placed and a type and cross performed. The patient's\nhematocrit was serially monitored. He was also maintained on an\nOctreotide and Protonix infusion. EGD showed esophagitis and\npossible [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  He was transitioned to omeprazole\n[**Hospital1 **].  He will continue on omeprazole on discharge to rehab and\nshould have follow CBC in 2 days [**2124-4-2**].\n.\n# Fall: Patient presented having fallen down 15 steps with a\nfeeling of light-headedness preceeding. The fall was likely due\nto alcohol intoxication from the [**1-24**] bottle of brandy that\npatient drank prior to admission, and possibly orthostasis in\nthe setting of GI bleeding and vomiting with diarrhea. He had\nback pain on presentation and had a CT-neck that showed no\nfracture, but chronic degenerative changes. On exam, patient had\nno neurologic deficits and had paraspinal neck tenderness with\nother tenderness radiating to the left shoulder. He had no\ntenderness at the midline. He was given a soft collar for\ncomfort for four weeks and discharged to follow-up with spine\ncenter in four weeks.  Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8603**]\nto set up a follow up appointment after discharge from rehab.\n.\n# Alcohol abuse: Per patient report, no current regular use\nexcept the night prior to admission. However, there was concern\nabout alcohol withdrawal in the ED. A CIWA scale was enacated\nand social work was consulted.  No signs of alcohol withdrawl\nduring hospitalization.  Patient counseled on importance of\nabsinence from alcohol.\n.\n# UTI: pt with no reported urinary symptoms, fevers, but urine\nculture + klebsiella/enterobacter(sensitive to cipro).  He was\nstarted on ciprofloxacin and will need a course for 14\ndays(complicated by foley).  The patient passed a voiding trial\nand the foley was removed.\n.\n# DM2: His home insulin (lantus 45 daily lispro 8 tid w/meals)\nwere held as he was npo and a insulin sliding scale was used.\nHis sugars ranged from 120-200 with insulin sliding scale.  He\nwill be discharged with a insulin sliding scale and his home\nregimen can be slowly restarted as his po intake improves.\n.\n# HTN: Unclear home regimen. Likely chronically runs high, but\nBP is significantly elevated now. He was continued on amlodipine\nand labetolol IV.  On discharge his amlodpine was 10mg.  If he\ncontinues to be hypertensive than po labetolol can be added.\n.\n# Hyperlipidemia: stable this admission.\n.\n# Bipolar disorder: Patient is on numerous psych medications,\nbut it is unclear who is prescribing them or how regularly he\ntakes them, or if he actually sees a psychiatrist. His last\nrecorded pasychiatry note was a no-show note from [**Month (only) 404**] of\n[**2123**].  Prozac and wellbutrin were restarted, but his seroquel\nand abilify were held after discussion with his pcp.\n.\n# MDS: Pt leukopenia and thrombocytopenia near baseline(per\ndiscussion with PCP).  No acute indication for transfusion.  He\nwill shedule a follow up appointment with his hematologist at\n[**Hospital3 **].\nTRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:\n1.

Old right\nposterior\nwatershed infarct and minimal amount of chronic microangiopathic\nchange.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n69F h/o CAD s/p multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF\n25%), DM2, asthma here with hypoglycemia, ARF after fall.  She\nwas initially admitted to the ICU and then transferred to the\nmedicine floor.\n.\n1. Hypoglycemia\n2. DM-2 Uncontrolled, with complications\nMost likely etiology of hypoglycemia is from continuing to take\nher baseline insulin in setting of acute renal insufficiency.\nAlso likely that she was getting more insulin than required as\nshe is not on steroids now and her dose was increased during her\nlast admission when she was on steroids.  No evidence of\ninfection.  She was given dextrose initially with improvement of\nher blood sugar and mental status.  Her home insulin was held\nand she was placed on an insulin sliding scale.  Patient\ninitially presented with hypoglycemic episode in setting of\nincreased insulin dose with some evidence of renal failure.\nStarted on Lantus during this admission, with dose titrated up\nto 15 units.  Also kept on humalog sliding scale.  Fingersticks\nwere reasonably controlled on this regimen, however she did have\nsome values in the low 200s, and will need further monitoring\nand adjusting of her dosage as an outpatient.\n.\n3. Acute Renal Failure\nLikely in setting of volume depletion.  Admission FeUrea < 35%\nin setting of decreased urine output.  Subsequently resolved\nwith hydration.  Lisinopril and Lasix had been held, now\nrestarted.  Cr continued to remain stable.\n.\n4. Heart Failure - chronic systolic and chronic diastolic\nLast TTE showed EF of 25% w/ grade III diastolic dysfunction.\nDid not appear volume overloaded.  O2 sats well maintained on\nroom air.  She was continued on Lasix, ACE-i, and B-blocker.\n.\n5. COPD - stable\nLabelled as having asthma and previously denied heavy smoking\nhx. However, last PFTs seemed more c/w emphysematous picture.\nCXRs show large lung volumes and flattening of diaphragms. Also,\nABG shows evidence of chronic retainer. Has scattered wheezes.\nShe was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.  While on the\nmedical floor, she remained off oxygen with O2 sats in the mid-\nto high-90s.  Given that she is a likely CO2 retainer, O2 sats\nshould not be kept high.\n.\n6. Coronary Artery Disease\nLong/complex cardiac hx. Has had failed CABG in past. Currently\nasymptomatic w/o chest pain/sob. Had troponin leak in setting of\ndemand and renal failure during this admission, however did not\nhave ACS.  She was continued on ASA 325, [**Doctor Last Name **], Statin, and\nB-blocker\n.\n7. LUE DVT - catheter associated\nHad been on Lovenox/Coumadin on discharge from previous\nadmission.  These were held on presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Was on\nheparin gtt in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to initial concern for ACS picture.\nThis was subsequently stopped.  Plan had been to do one-month\ncourse of anticoagulation for UE DVT.  However, given patient's\nwaxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, tendency to pull out lines, recent\nfall, and the fact that DVT was in the upper extremity, risk of\nanticoagulation would likely outweigh any benefit.  She was\nmaintained on prophylactic SC Heparin.\n.\n8. Depression\nStable. Continued on Paxil\n.\n9. Altered Mental Status/Likely dementia w/ recent fall and\nepisode of being non-verbal\nDo not suspect there has been an acute change in mental status.\nGiven vascular hx, would consider multi-infarct dementia (vs.\nearly Alzheimer's dementia) as possible etiology for overall\nconfusion.  Head CT did not show acute bleed or evidence of new\ninfarct.  On the day of transfer to the floor, the patient was\nnon-verbal.  She was able to follow commands, however seemed to\nbe more lethargic than usual and seemed unable to speak.  A\nrepeat head CT did not show any acute findings.  She\nsubsequently returned back to her baseline.  Given the overall\npoor mental status over the past few months, the patient would\nbenefit from outpatient neuropsychological testing and possibly\nfurther imaging of her head.\n.\n10. Question of Paroxysmal A-fib\nPatient was generally in sinus rhythm at a well controlled rate\nwhile in house.  However, per notes, has had episodes of A-fib\nin the past.  Anticoagulation issue discussed as above.  Issue\nof anticoagulation will have to be addressed as an outpatient.\nShe may benefit from an assessment of her disease burden (if\nany) of the A-fib.\n.\nDisposition:\nPatient failed at home given readmission.  PT consult\nrecommended rehab.  Discussed issue with patient's daughter,\n[**Name (NI) 107611**].

She says that the pain is\ndull, constant, and nonradiating, and is located below the\numbilicus.  Her diarrhea is nonbloody, and she denies black\nor tarry stools.  She says she has also had some nausea and\nshortness of breath over the past four days and recently\nchills.  She denies the following; fevers, headaches, chest\npain, palpitations, flank pain, dysuria, change in urination\nor frequency, arthralgias, or myalgias.  She also denies\nrecent changes in her medications or recent alcohol or drug\nuse.  Of note, she had an abdominal computed tomography\nyesterday with intravenous contrast.  At that time, her blood\nurea nitrogen was 49, and her creatinine was 4.5.\n\nIn the Emergency Department, she was started on normal saline\ninfusion at 75 mL per hour.  She also received one ampule of\nglucose for a fingerstick blood glucose in the 60s.  Serum\nelectrolyte panel revealed her blood urea nitrogen was 59.\nHer creatinine was 5.3 (her baseline is 20 to 30/1.1 to 1.3;\nrespectively).  This revealed hyponatremia and acidemia that\nhad been stable over the past one to two months.\n\nElectrocardiogram revealed inferolateral ST-T wave changes\nnot seen on the last study from [**2178-2-14**]; which could be\nconsistent with myocardial ischemia.  Her cardiac enzymes\nwere not elevated on the first draw.  An abdominal computed\ntomography revealed a pan-colitis.   A head computed\ntomography was negative.\n\nShe was transferred to the floor for management of her\npan-colitis and acute renal failure.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Type 1 renal tubular acidosis; complicated by\nhypokalemia, acidemia, and recently hyponatremia (126 to 128\nin [**2178-6-16**]).  She is on a low-salt diet with a 1-liter\nper day fluid restriction.\n2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy complicated by congestive heart\nfailure diagnosed in [**2178-2-14**].  An echocardiogram at\nthat time revealed an ejection fraction of 25% with akinesis\nof the inferior and basilar walls.  Since then, she has been\nstable with [**State 531**] Heart Association class II symptoms.\n3.  Coronary artery disease; cardiac catheterization in [**2178-2-14**] revealed a 100% occlusion of the right coronary\nartery which was stented.\n4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma.\n5.  Anxiety and depression.\n6.  Attention deficit disorder.\n7.  Osteoporosis.\n8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n1.

She denies alcohol use.  The patient is\nsingle with no children and lives alone.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:   Mother died at the age of 67 with\ncerebrovascular accident and also with coronary artery\ndisease.  Father died at the age of 40 from a motor vehicle\naccident.  Sister has diabetes and breast cancer.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination\non admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.6\ndegrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 113/60, her heart\nrate was 88, her respiratory rate was 22, and her oxygen\nsaturation was 96% on room air.  In general, the patient was\nshivering, lying in bed.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat\nexamination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils\nwere equal, round, and reactive to light.  No nystagmus.  The\noral mucosa was pink and slightly dry.  No lesions.  Neck\nexamination revealed a large soft tissue mass.  No\nlymphadenopathy appreciated.  Chest examination revealed\ncoarse breath sounds bilaterally with decreased breath sounds\nat the right base.  Cardiovascular examination revealed\nnormal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  A regular\nrate and rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic murmur.  Abdominal\nexamination revealed hypoactive bowel sounds.  The abdomen\nwas soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No organomegaly or\nmasses appreciated.  Guaiac-negative in the Emergency\nDepartment.  Extremity examination revealed the lower\nextremities were cool to touch.  Posterior tibialis pulse\nwere 1+ bilaterally.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial\nnerves II through XII were intact.  Sharp discrimination poor\nover the upper and lower extremities bilaterally.  Oriented\nto person and place but not to time.  Skin examination\nrevealed mild reaction of turgor over hand, small lesions\nover body.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Admission\nlaboratory data revealed her white blood cell count was 8.7,\nher hematocrit was 31.9, and her platelets were 202.  Her\nsodium was 124, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 95,\nbicarbonate was 13, blood urea nitrogen was 59, creatinine\nwas 5, and blood glucose was 166.  Prothrombin time was 13.3,\npartial thromboplastin time was 26.1, and her INR was 1.3.\nHer ALT was 5, AST was 16, alkaline phosphatase was 97, total\nbilirubin was 0.3, amylase was 164, and her lipase was 66.\nAlbumin was 3.5.  Calcium was 8.2.  Lactate was 1.1.\n\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram from [**7-31**] showed first-degree atrioventricular block, poor R wave\nprogression, inferolateral ST-T changes which may represent\nmyocardial ischemia.\n\nAn abdominal computed tomography with contrast on [**7-30**]\nshowed pan-colitis.\n\nA head computed tomography from [**7-31**] showed no acute\npathological intracranial process.\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:\n\n 1.  PAN-COLITIS ISSUES:  On admission, the patient was made\nnothing by mouth.  Stool studies were sent.  Cultures for\nClostridium difficile, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter,\nYersinia, and ova and parasites all were negative.  She was\nstarted on antibiotics with ciprofloxacin 200 mg\nintravenously q.24h. and metronidazole 500 mg intravenously\nq.8h.  She was also stool guaiaced which were all negative.\n\nDuring the course of her hospitalization, she was switched to\na course of ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and\ncompleted a 10-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl.\n\nGastroenterology saw the patient in consultation and agreed\nwith the plan to treat with antibiotics and recommended a\nflexible sigmoidoscopy after resolution of her symptoms.\n\nOn [**8-11**], she had a repeat abdominal computed tomography\nwhich showed resolution of her pan-colitis.  Throughout the\ncourse of her hospital stay, her abdominal pain subsided; now\nonly intermittent and only with deep palpation.\n\n 2.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES AND TYPE I RENAL TUBULAR\nACIDOSIS ISSUES:  Acute renal failure was presumed to be\npredominantly prerenal and perhaps some component of acute\ntubular necrosis secondary to the computed tomography dye\nload that she received on [**7-30**].  At baseline, this\npatient has hyponatremia and acidemia secondary to her type I\nrenal tubular acidosis for which she takes 650 mg twice per\nday of bicarbonate.\n\nThe patient was gently hydrated on the floor.  Her\nelectrolytes were repleted, and her medications were renally\ndosed.  Her ACE inhibitors and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory\nagents were held during the course of her hospitalization.\n\nIn the Intensive Care Unit, the patient remained oliguric\nwith an average urine output of 200 cc to 300 cc per day.\n\n 3.  SEIZURE ISSUES:  The patient had a seizure after being\nadmitted to the floor on [**8-1**].  She was stabilized, and\nthe seizure resolved with Ativan and Dilantin.\n\nShe was seen in consultation by Neurology.  She had a lumbar\npuncture which was negative.  She also had a head computed\ntomography at that time which showed edema.  She had magnetic\nresonance imaging as well which showed decreased perfusion in\nher right frontal lobe as well as a nonspecific increased T2\nsignal on the pons.  She had an electroencephalogram which\nwas negative.\n\nNeurology felt that her seizure was caused by a metabolic or\ntoxic abnormality.  She was loaded with Dilantin and was\ncontinued on Dilantin in the Intensive Care Unit.  She did\nnot have any additional seizures during the course of her\nhospitalization.\n\n 4.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  Congestive heart failure with an\nejection fraction of 20% to 25% and coronary artery disease,\nstatus post stent placement.\n\nAfter the seizure she suffered on the floor, the patient had\na cardiac enzyme leak and mild electrocardiogram changes;\nlikely representing demand ischemia.\n\nAfter her transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, she became\nhypotensive which necessitated volume resuscitation.  While\nin the Intensive Care Unit, she was diuresed with Lasix and\nDiuril.  She was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.  She also\nbegan hemodialysis because she was relatively refractory to\nLasix treatment.\n\nRegarding her congestive heart failure, eventually the\npatient was placed on Isordil, hydralazine, and most recently\nmetoprolol was added to her regimen.  Hemodialysis has been\nthe most effective treatment in terms of volume reduction.\nShe continued to receive Lasix 100 mg intravenously three\ntimes per day (per Renal instructions).\n\n 5.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  After the patient's seizure\non the floor, she became overwhelmingly acidotic and was\ntransferred to the Intensive Care Unit for her respiratory\nfailure and was placed on a ventilator.  She was extubated on\n[**8-3**] for six hours until she went into flash pulmonary\nedema and was reintubated.  At that time, she was started on\nNatrecor and then switched to dialysis and received her first\ndialysis treatment on [**8-5**]; which she continued to have\non an as needed basis (per Renal directive).\n\nThe patient was extubated on [**8-11**] and continued to do\nwell status post extubation; currently using a 50% shovel\nmask with oxygen saturations of 95% to 100% with a\nrespiratory rate of around 12.  The patient was not\ncomplaining of shortness of breath.\n\n 6.  ANISOCORIA/WEAKNESS ISSUES:  The patient has had noted\nanisocoria during her hospitalization with the right pupil\nbeing larger than the left pupil.\n\nHowever, on the morning of [**8-12**], she was noted to have a\nlarger left pupil at 4 mm and a right pupil of 2 mm as well\nas marked left upper extremity weakness.  At that time,\nNeurology was consulted again regarding this new finding.\n\nShe was seen today by Neurology and was scheduled for a\nmagnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography\nlater today (on [**8-12**]).\n\n 7.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on\nlevothyroxine.\n\n 8.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE/ASTHMA ISSUES:\nThe patient was on Atrovent q.4h. and was started on a\nfluticasone steroid inhaler today for continued wheezing and\nsome chest tightness.\n\n 9.  ANXIETY/DEPRESSION ISSUES:  During the course of her\nIntensive Care Unit stay, sertraline was held and she\nreceived Ativan with her propofol sedation.  As she was\nextubated, we have restarted Ativan 1 mg by mouth every day\nas well as her trazodone 50 mg by mouth once per day.\n\n10.  CODE STATUS:  Full code.\n\n11.

The\nearly part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was dictated by\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM\n(CONTINUED):  The patient was transferred out of the\nIntensive Care Unit on [**2178-8-13**].\n\n1.  RENAL ISSUES:  While on the Medicine floor, the patient\nunderwent further diuresis with Lasix and metolazone.  The\npatient was continued on hemodialysis.\n\nThe patient was followed closely by the Renal Service.\nGradually, her renal function and acidosis improved.\nTherefore, hemodialysis was discontinued.\n\n2.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient underwent a magnetic\nresonance imaging of her brain on [**2178-8-13**].  This\nmagnetic resonance imaging demonstrated areas of signal\nabnormalities that probably represented subacute infarction.\n\nA magnetic resonance angiography of the cervical vasculature\nrevealed no hemodynamically significant stenoses.\n\nThe patient was followed closely by the Neurology Service.\nIt was recommended that she be started on Dilantin for\nseizure prophylaxis.  Due to difficulties achieving\ntherapeutic Dilantin levels, the patient was changed to\nKeppra.\n\nHer neurological functional status improved over the\nremainder of her hospitalization, and the patient had\nimproved movement of her left side.\n\n3.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was continued on\nIsordil, hydralazine, beta blocker, and Lasix.\n\nThe Cardiology Service was consulted for further workup of\nher cardiomyopathy.  Cardiac catheterization was pursued, yet\nthis procedure was put on hold given since the patient had\nundergone a cardiac catheterization on a previous admission.\nThe results of that cardiac catheterization were consistent\nwith ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient worked with Physical\nTherapy and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\n1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.\n2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.\n3.  Simvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.\n4.  Hydralazine 20 mg by mouth four times per day.\n5.  Synthroid 0.088 mg by mouth once per day.\n6.  Lasix 60 mg by mouth once per day.\n7.  Keppra 250 mg by mouth twice per day.\n8.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Renal tubular acidosis (type 1).\n2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n3.  Coronary artery disease.\n4.  Acute renal failure.\n5.

A CT without\ncontrast was performed (details above) without evidence acute GI\nprocess. Subsequently the patient underwent a CTA of the abdomen\nfor which she received IVF and was laid flat during which she\nbecame short of breath and subsequently hypertensive to the\n200's (details given below). The pt was seen by Vascular Surgery\nin the ED that felt the symptoms were not consistent with acute\nmesenteric ischemia and in addition she had a normal lactate.\nThe final read of the CTA was unreaveling for any acute process.\nDuring the patients hospital course her pain appeared to\nlocalize to the site of the kidney transplant in the LLQ.\nTransplant surgery was called to evaluate her transplant kidney,\nbut subsequent ultrasounds were unrevealing for perinephric\ncollections, hydronephrosis or signs of ischemia. The patients\nabdominal pain resolved by the time of her discharge of which\nthe differential still remains: Gastritis (possibly secondary to\na recent steroid taper, PUD, Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia\nsecondary to abundant mesenteric calcifications and chronic\naortic disection.\n.\n# Acute Pulmonary Edema: Patient with known dCHF with preserved\nEF as well as moderate pulmonary HTN. Acute pulmonary edema was\nlikely excerbated in the setting of hypertensive urgency\nfollowing her IVF (given at a rate of 200cc/hr prior to CTA) as\nwell as HTN secondary to panic as evident by her saying \"\"I need\nair\"\" in the ED. The patient was brought to the ICU for closer\nmonitoring and was placed on BiPap as well as given IV Lasix.\nUpon transfer to the floor the patients lungs were mostly clear\nto ausculation with scant crackls R>L. The pt was clinically\neuvolemic and breathing comforatbly on room air. Of note this\npresentation very similar to prior admission where pt recieved\nfluids and subsequently reqiured tranfer to the unit. The\npatient remained on room air for the duration of her\nhospitalization.\n.\n# Hypertensive: Following the patients work-up in the ED the pt\nwas admitted to the MICU with hypertensive urgency with SBP to\nthe 200s . The patient was given Labetalol and subsequently\ntransfered to floor on PO Labetalol for SBP control. The patient\nuses Labetalol as a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as an outpatient.  The patient\nwas started on low-dose calcium blocker (amlodipine) in the\nsetting of SBPs 140-160s as an inpatient.\n.\n# ESRD s/p Transplant: The patient was followed by transplant\nsurgery service while in-house. K+ was 5.9 on admission, and the\npt subsequently received Kayexelate which improved to levels\nWNL.  The patients had a baseline creatinine of 1.8 in early\n[**Month (only) **]. On admission the patients Cr was elevated at 2.3,\npeaking at 2.8 and returning to 2.1 with  gentle hydration. The\npatient was continued on home regimen of azathioprine/tacrolimus\nwhile following Tacrolimus levels.\n.\n# Anemia: The patients HCT ranged from 23 through 28 from\napproximately 30s at her baseline in the setting of one recent\nepisode of dark stools, without frank melena, BRBPR. Patient\nchronically on Epogen from long term renal disease. B12 and\nfolate were WNL and haptoglobin was not decreased.\n.\n# CAD: Pt with known CAD, followed by cards as outpatient with\nknown distal RCA occlusion. No symptoms of angina on admission\nand  was ruled out with unchanged EKG. The patient then\nsubsequently developed one episode of chest pain. The patient\nwas sent for a pMIBI ( as detailed above) that showed no new\nlesions.  The pt was continued on ASA and beta-blocker.\n.\n# Chronic Aortic Disection: Chronic in nature. CT abd with\ncontrast performed overnight. Pt reporting back pain. Hct has\nbeen slowly decreasing. CT unchanged from prior studies.\n.\n# COPD: Pt with 40 pack-yr hx. Not on home 02.

For details, see the\nseparately-dictated operative note.\n\nNEURO/PAIN:\nThe patient's pain was initially well-controlled with an\nepidural. Upon discontinuatin of the epidural, he was well\ncontrolled on PO tylenol. On POD#1 and POD#2, the patient had\nepisodes of confusion and agitation, necessitating soft\nrestraints in the ICU; his mental status improved considerably\nafter discontinuation of all narcotics, and he remained\ngenerally well-oriented (with only occasional periods of mild\ndisorientation at night) through to his day of discharge.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable. His\nvitals signs were monitored with telemetry.\n\nRESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated in the immediate post-op\nperiod successfully. On POD#2, during an episode of agitation,\nan ABG showed respiratory alkalosis and mild hypoxia; a CT then\nwas negative for PE. He subsequently improved from this episode,\nboth in terms of his mental status and respiratory status. For\nthe remainder of his stay he maintained good oxygentation with\n1-2L supplemental O2 via nasal cannula.\n\nGASTROINTESTINAL: The patient had a minimally-invasive\nesophagectomy on [**2141-1-13**]. He generally followed the MIE pathway.\nHis j-tube feeds were started on POD#1 and advanced to goal.\nDuring an episode of agitation on POD#2, he did remove his NGT,\nand this was replaced without incident. He was NPO until POD#6,\nwhen his barium swallow study showed good passage of contrast\nwith no leak, and he was advanced to full liquids, which he\ntolerated well. He is discharged with VNA and supplies to\ncontinue tube feeding at home.\n\nGENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was monitored. A Foley\ncatheter was placed intra-operatively and removed on POD#5, at\nwhich time the patient was able to successfully void.\n\nHEME: The patient's hematocrit was monitored daily, and he\nrequired no transfusions. His preoperative anticoagulation was\nresomed on POD#7 with a lovenox bridge to coumadin.\n\nID: The patient did have a temperature of 101.2 on POD#2, but\nthis resolved and he required no antibiotics. He had no further\nfevers and his white blood count remained normal. On CXR the day\nof discharge he did have a patchy right-sided opacity. However\nhe remained asymptomatic, afebrile with no productive cough. He\nis scheduled for follow up CXR and CBC on follow up next week.\n\nENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was monitored and he had\nno significant endocrine issues.\n\nPROPHYLAXIS: The patient was maintained on SQ heparin,\npneumoboots, and encouraged to ambulate with the help of\nphysical therapy. He was given pantoprazole and an inspiratory\nspirometer.\n\nHe was discharged in stable condition, pain well controlled,\nvoiding well, and with instructions and appropriate\nprescriptions for supplemental oxygen and tube feeds.

No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or\ncolor Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size\nare normal.\nThere is moderate regional left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction. Overall left\nventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting\nregional wall\nmotion abnormalities include mid to apical anteroseptal\nakinesis/hypokinesis\nand anterior and anterolateral wall hypokinesis. Right\nventricular chamber\nsize and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets\nare moderately\nthickened with trace aortic regurgitation. There is mild to\nmoderate aortic\nvalve stenosis (valve gradient low due to reduced stroke\nvolume). The mitral\nvalve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)\nmitral\nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate mitral annular\ncalcification with a\nmild left ventricular inflow gradient. There is mild pulmonary\nartery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nImpression:\nModerate regional systolic LV dysfunction c/w CAD\nModerate to severe mitral regurgitation.\nMild to moderate aortic stenosis.\nMild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension\n\nCompared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2105-9-21**], a\nslightly higher\naortic valve gradient is now measured (likely related to\nslightly better\ntechnical quality of Doppler spectral measurement in the current\nstudy). Left\nventricular systolic function and mitral valve appear similar.\nTricuspid\nsystolic gradient is now slightly lower.\n\nCath [**10-23**]:FINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1.

Found to have NSTEMI, with a positive troponin of\n0.12 and was admitted for cardiac cath.\n\nOn cardiac cath [**9-18**] she was found to have an ulcerated 80%\nlesion in the proximal SV to LAD graft. She underwent succesful\nPTCA/stenting of the proximal and mid SVG to LAD with 2 Zeta\nstents. Limited resting hemodynamics showed elevated central\naortic pressures (200/65mmHg). LV gram was not performed due to\nrenal insufficiency.\n\nThe patient recieved IV hydration with bicarb prior to and\npost-cath. In the holding area post-cath she became hypoxic\nrequiring non-rebreather with O2 sats still in the low 90's. She\nwas felt to be fluid overloaded and a CXR was consistent with\nflorid CHF. She was given 20 mg IV lasix,then lasix 100mg IV and\nwas started on Natrecor drip. She was then transferred to the\nCCU for further management.\n\nShe continued to have SSCP rated from [**Date range (1) 92236**] after arriving\nin CCU. SL NTG and Nitro paste were tried with minor relief.\nThen the patient was started on Nitro drip + morphine with\nrelief. Of note, she has tolerated nitrates well despite her h/o\nHOCM. Her cardiac enzymes were also elevated overnight post-cath\nand this was felt to be possibly related to showering of\nmicroemboli from her SVG into her microvasculature. She\nsubsequently had resolution of her CK's and chest pain resolved.\nHowever, on return to the floor she had persistent chest pains\ndespite nitro drip, prompting re-look catheritization.\n\nRe-look cath on [**9-23**] showed the LCX to have serial 70% lesions\nat the mid-segment. The SVG-->LAD was patent (mild residual\nstenosis at the proximal stent). The mid-LCX was successfully\nstented with a bare meta (heparin coated) stent. Of note, the\npatient required non-rebreather tx and was transferred to CCU\nfor management of her CHF. The patinet was diuresed on natrecore\nand lasix in the unit and transferred back to the floor on [**9-25**].\n\n\nOn return to the floor she was found to be mildly SOB, without\nchest pressure or palpitations. JVP was up at 10cm's and she had\ncrackles on exam to apices with decreased air movement at the\nbases. She was given 200mg IV lasix for goal diuresis of -500cc.\nShe was continued on lasix prn for goal of even to -500cc/day.\nOxygen status improved and she was able to maintain 96%O2 on RA.\n\n\nSet-up was made for diialysis on [**9-28**] with permcath placement.\nOn her second day of dialysis, treatment was terminated early\nsecondary to chest pain and SOB. NTG x 3 was given with\nsub-total relief of symptoms. She had an increased O2\nrequirement to 4L O2, with increasing SOB overnight. She\ndesaturated to 88% on 6L NC and was started on a non-rebreather.\nAt this time, she was found to have elevated JVP, tachypnea and\nrales up to the apex. EKG was performed and showed no evidence\nof acute MI (in the setting of baseline LBBB). She was given\n200mg IV lasix and 250mg IV diuril with minimal response. Nitro\ndrip was titrated up to 200mcgs and 4mg IV morphine was given to\nalleviate chest pain. Foley catheter was placed with minimal\nreturn (<10cc). Natrecor drip was started at 0.01mcg/kg/min. ABG\ndemonstrated 7.23/65/66 with bicarb of 21, c/w an acute\nrespiratory acidosis. BIPAP was placed for respiratory support\nand she was again transferred to the CCU. Of note, she was found\nto have evidence as well of a new LLL pneumonia by CXR ,with a\nWBC of 15.6, and was started on Levaquin/Flagyl.\n\nHemodialysis after transfer to CCU removed 2.0kg, but was c/b\nhypotensive episodes w/ SBP decreased to the 70's. Hypotension\nresolved with 500 cc NS IVF support. Subsequent hemodialysis was\nwell tolerated with maintenance of her blood pressures. Of note,\nshe did have shoulder/chest pain  + throat itchiness on HD #4.\nThis was alleviated with 4mg morphine and NTG. Chest pain was\nnoted to be resolved by the end of treatment. She was\ntransferred back to the floor in stable condition for continued\nmedical management.\n\nShe has been on room air and maintaining sats >93% since return\nfrom CCU on [**10-1**]. Lungs are clear. She has been euvolemic with\ncurrent course of Hemodialysis Tu,Th,Sat. She has remained chest\npain free for >3 days. Of note, she is completing a course of\nGentamicin antibiotics for an uncomplicated E.Coli UTI. She will\nneed 2 more doses upon discharge.\n\nA brief [**Hospital 92237**] hospital problem list is outlined below:\n\n1)CHF: better compensated with diuresis JVD flat; ACE-I,\nb-blocker; re-started dig at 0.25 qd.

However,\ngiven absence of infiltrate on subsequent CXR, Levo/Flagyl was\nD/C'd. Repeat urine cultures demonstrated E.coli R to\nlevaquin/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on Gent at 100mg Bolus, +\n60mgQHD x 1 week for uncomplicated E.Coli UTI. This was\nincreased to 80mg QHD on [**10-9**]. She will need two more doses\nafter discharge to complete her course.\n\n4)CRF: HD per renal, through tunneled dialysis cath.

She also had a recent event of subtotal\ncolectomy for diffused colitis of unspecific etiology.  She\nhad a recent admission for partial small bowel obstruction,\nwhich resolved with conservative therapy.  She is now\nreadmitted with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and\nabdominal distention.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, end-stage renal disease,\ncoronary artery disease, legally blind, hypertension,\ngastroparesis, asthma, partial strokes, small bowel\nobstruction, toxic megacolon, status post kidney and pancreas\ntransplant in [**2-22**], kidney retransplant in [**2-23**], ventral\nhernia repair, PD catheter placement, coronary artery bypass\ngraft in [**2126**], and subtotal colectomy with ileostomy in\n[**10-26**].\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n1.

Chest was\nclear to auscultation.  Heart sounds were normal.  Her\nabdomen was soft and moderately distended with no tenderness.\nOf note, on digital exam of the ileostomy there was a\ntightness of the fascia.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted with partial bowel\nobstruction and a nasogastric tube was placed and IV\nhydration started.  An abdominal x-ray showed some distended\nsmall bowel loops.  Her abdomen remained soft and nontender.\nDuring this admission, we decided, as she was over two months\nout from her colectomy, to take down the ileostomy and\nrestore bowel continuity.  She was, therefore, taken to the\noperating room after appropriate hydration and an ileostomy\ntake down and ileorectal anastomosis performed without\ndifficulty.  She developed some oliguria postoperatively and\nrequired a short stay in the intensive care unit.  Subsequent\nto that, she made a good recovery and had early return of\nbowel function and tolerated a diet.  She was discharged home\nby one week postoperatively in a stable condition.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Partial small bowel obstruction.\n\nType I diabetes, status post kidney-pancreas transplantation.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She is to resume her routine\nimmunosuppressant medications per the transplant center.\n\nFOLLOW UP:  In the Transplant Center.\n\n\n\n                        [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], [**MD Number(1) 4841**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 32797**]\nMEDQUIST36\nD:  [**2129-8-23**] 14:38:18\nT:  [**2129-8-25**] 13:39:35\nJob#:  [**Job Number 92732**]\n\"\n41736,44373,162053,2187-06-06,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2187-5-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-6-6**]\n\nDate of Birth:  [**2104-6-21**]             Sex:   M\n\nService: MEDICINE\n\nAllergies:\nindomethacin / Heparin Agents\n\nAttending:[**Attending Info 90680**]\nChief Complaint:\nshortness of breath\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n[**2187-5-19**] left internal jugular vein dialysis catheter placement\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nMr. [**Known lastname 90678**] is an 82y/o gentleman with critical AS ([**Location (un) 109**]\n<0.8cm2), Afib on Coumadin, CHF (EF 30-35%), HTN, HLD, DM II,\nCKD IV (Cr ~4 baseline), and CML who presented to the ED with\nshortness of breath and hemoptsysis and has been found to have\nCHF exacerbation.\n\nOf note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiology [**Date range (1) 90681**]\nfor CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary indiscretion.\nDuring that stay, he was diuresed with IV Lasix and transitioned\nto 160mg PO BID.

Incompletely\ncharacterized right basilar opacification, which may reflect a\npleural\neffusion, but is not well characterized.\n.\nCT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2187-5-14**]:\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Air outlines the anterior wall of the bladder which could\nrepresent\ncystitis in the appropriate clinical setting.  Additionally,\nthere is a focal area of heterogeneous dense material within the\nbladder lumen which suggests a focal mass.  Urine cytology and\nfurther assessment with either ultrasound or direct urological\nevaluation should be considered.\n2.  Minimal atherosclerotic calcification of the common and\nexternal iliac and common femoral vessels.\n3.  Increased trabeculation of the right ilium, consistent with\nPaget's\ndisease.\n.\nCXR [**2187-5-19**]:\nFINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from [**2187-5-14**].\nThere is a left IJ central venous catheter with distal lead tip\nin the brachiocephalic vein.  This could be advanced several\ncentimeters for more optimal placement.  There are persistent\nbilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  There is\nunchanged cardiomegaly.  There is mild pulmonary edema.\n.\nCXR [**2187-5-23**]:\nFINDINGS:  A single portable chest radiograph is limitted by low\nlung volumes and mild rotation.  Mild pulmonary edema has\nimproved but there is now a small amout of fluid in the right\nminor fissure.  A left internal jugular catheter tip remains at\nthe confluence of the left brachiocephalic and SVC.  Apparent\nworsening of cardiomegally is likely secondary to technique.\nFINDINGS:  Slight improvement in pulmonary edema.\n.\nKUB [**2187-5-23**]:\nFINDINGS:  Portable supine and upright frontal views of the\nabdomen\ndemonstrate a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with gas in\nnon-distended loops of small and large bowel.  No air-fluid\nlevels are seen.  The right hemidiaphragm is excluded from view\non these images which limits evaluation for free intraperitoneal\nair.  However, there is no evidence of a large amount of free\nair within the abdomen.  Multilevel moderate degenerative\nchanges are noted in the visualized lower thoracic and lumbar\nspine.  The visualized right lung base is clear, but there is\napparent rightward shifting of mediastinum.  The left lung base\nis not well evaluated.  Recommend correlation with same day\nchest radiograph.\nIMPRESSION:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without gaseous\ndistention of the colon.\n\n[**2187-6-5**] RUQ ULTRASOUND:\nFINDINGS:  Note is made that only a partial ultrasound exam was\nperformed as the patient refused to complete the examination.\nNo biliary dilatation is seen.  No focal liver lesion is\nidentified.  The\ngallbladder is contracted.  The portal vein is patent with\nhepatopetal flow.  The intrahepatic portion of the IVC is\nunremarkable.  There is a right pleural effusion.\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Contracted gallbladder with no biliary dilatation.  No focal\nliver lesion is seen.\n2.  Right pleural effusion. Only a partial exam was performed as\nthe patient refused to complete.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [**Known lastname 90678**] is an 82 year old gentleman with critical aortic\nstenosis (AS), Afib on Coumadin, chronic kidney disease (CKD)\nstage IV (Cr ~2.5 baseline), and chronic myelocytic leukemia\n(CML) who presented with acute on chronic systolic heart\nfailure.  He was thought not to be a candidate for any aortic\nvalve procedures including balloon valvuloplasty and his kidneys\ndid not tolerate diuretics for the heart failure exacerbation.\nHe was transferred to the CCU for CVVH which brought him back to\neuvolemia and he was transitioned to intermittent HD.  His\ncourse was complicated by C.difficile diarrhea, development of\nperipheral blasts in the setting of his CML, and probable\nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia.  He eventually expired on\n[**2187-6-6**] from a PEA arrest after having chest pain during\nhemodialysis earlier in the day, he was DNR/DNI so resuscitation\nwas not attempted.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure (sCHF): He presented\nwith progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower\nextremity edema consistent with acute on chronic sCHF.  Most\nrecent TTE from previous admission in [**3-/2187**] showed EF 30-35%,\nlikely due to critical AS (see below). (Cardiac cath during\nprevious admission showed no clinically significant coronary\nartery disease.)  He was started on IV lasix gtt, however\ndiuresis was difficult due to his low blood pressure and his\npreload dependence from AS.  Also, his creatinine continued to\nrise.  His urine output declined and on HD#6 he was transferred\nto CCU for initiation of CVVH for volume removal (see below).\nHe did well and returned to [**Location 52753**] on CVVH with removal of\n10L of fluid.\n\n# Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt has stage IV CKD with most\nrecent creatinine on discharge 2.5.  His creatinine gradually\nincreased from 2.7 on admission to 4.7 and BUN 110-120.  This\nwas felt most likely due to decreased renal perfusion in setting\nof acute on chronic heart failure.  His urine output declined\nand he began to demonstrate signs and symptoms of uremia with\nnausea/vomiting, AMS and asterixis.  The renal service was\nconsulted and recommended trial of more aggressive diuresis with\nmetolazone/lasix.  His urine output did not improve and he was\ntransferred to the CCU for placement of temporary dialysis line\nand CVVH.  He did well and returned to [**Location 52753**] on CVVH with\nremoval of 10L of fluid.  After discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and\nfamily about no options for valve repair, he was trialed on\nintermittent HD.  He did tolerate intermittent HD with blood\npressures in the 70s/40s but he was mentating.  He was started\non 10mg midodrine prior to dialysis and a tunnelled HD line was\nplaced to allow for outpatient HD.  Was continued on calcium\nTID, calcitriol daily, and sevalamer with meals.  Kayexelate was\nused for hyperkalemia between HD sessions.  There had been\ndiscussions with renal and transplant surgery about\ntransitioning to peritoneal dialysis which might be gentler on\nthe patient's blood pressure.  However, the patient developed\nHITT and then expired before this was carried out.\n\n# Critical AS: Pt has known critical AS (most recent [**Location (un) 109**]\n<0.8cm2).  He has been evaluated for his options to repair or\nreplace aortic valve, including AVR, TAVI, or balloon\nangioplasty. He was deemed to be a high risk candidate for\nsurgical AVR, and unfortunately he does not qualify for the\nCoreValve protocol because of his renal insufficiency (creatine\nclearance < 20 cc).  The risks and benefits of valvuloplasty\nwere discussed with the patient and his family, including\nlikelihood that he would continue to be HD-dependent as well as\nrisk of stroke.  It was decided that he would not undergo\nballoon valvuloplasty and to transition to HD as above for fluid\nmanagement.  Later in the hospitalization, the family again\npushed for balloon valvuloplasty and there were discussions with\nthe interventional cardiologist about possible valvuloplasty\nhowever the patient developed HITT and these discussions were\nheld.\n\n# Heparin-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (HITT): After\nseveral days of heparin used for anticoagulation of afib as well\nas for dialysis, he developed thrombocytopenia.  Platelets were\nnoted to decrease from 232 on [**5-25**] to nadir of 66 on [**5-31**]. This\nwas in the setting of restarting hydroxyurea. He had no clinical\nevidence of thrombotic disease.  His HITT antibody was positive\nat an optical density which suggested to hematology consultant\nthat he did indeed have HITT.  There was a serotonin release\nassay sent to confirm this diagnosis which was pending when he\nexpired.  He was taken off heparin and started on argatroban to\nstop thrombosis from HITT as well as prophylaxis for his afib\nwith CHADS2 score of 6.  All further discussions for balloon\nvalvuloplasty and peritoneal dialysis catheter placement were on\nhold pending HITT work-up.\n\n# C.diff associated diarrhea: He developed large volume diarrhea\nand a C.diff was positive.  He was initially treated with PO\nvancomycin only because of his age, creatinine, and WBC count.\nHowever, his leukocytosis continued to worsen so IV flagyl was\nadded to the regimen and his PO vancomycin dose was increased to\n500 mg Q6h.  When he continued to have rising leukocytosis on\nthis regimen a repeat set of cultures was sent on all body\nfluids and his urine grew VRE (see below).  The antibiotic\nsteward recommended use fo tigecycline to dual treat VRE in the\nurine and C.diff.  His diarrhea resolved, as well as abdominal\npain and it was felt that his rising leukocytosis was due to\nleukemoid reaction of abnormal bone marrow from CML (see below).\n He was narrowed again to PO vancomycin 125 po q6 hours to\ncomplete a 14 day course following completion of 7 days of\ntigecycline 50 mg q12h for VRE in the urine.  His course was\nsupposed to finish on [**6-13**].\n\n# Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE): His urine culture did\ngrow VRE on two occasions.  He was felt to be colonized with\nthis pathogen because his urinalysis both times had 16 and then\n3 WBCs, which would be expected to have a more robust pyuria if\nhe was acutely infected.  Nonetheless, because of rising\nleukocytosis, he was treated for VRE with tigecycline which\nwould dual-cover his C.diff above.  He completed a 7 day course\nfor complicated urinary tract infection since male gender and\nfoley.  Even after treatment, his renal failure did not improve.\n\n# Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML): Pt's WBC gradually\nincreased from 17.2 on admission to peak of 84.  Infectious work\nup revealed C.diff infection and colonization of urine with\nvancomycin-resistant enterococcus (cultures positive but UA\nwithout pyuria indicating asymptomatic colonization).\nNonetheless, his white count continued to rise even after\nclinical resolution of C.diff and with empiric treatment of VRE.\n Felt most likely due to CML since his hydroxyurea was recently\ndiscontinued due to renal failure and thrombocytopenia.  The\nAtrius oncology service was consulted and recommended restarting\nhydroxyurea.  He did also eventually develop a small percentage\nof his differential with peripheral blasts but this may have\nbeen a leukemoid reaction.  Given his overall poor prognosis it\nwas decided to continue just the hydroxyurea without pursuing\nmore aggressive work up such as bone marrow biopsy.  His WBC\ngradually downtrended on hydroxyurea 1000 mg daily before\nreducing to 500mg daily in setting of thrombocytopenia.\n\n# Hematuria: Pt had hematuria during previous admission that\nrequired CBI and holding anticoagulation.  Warfarin was\nrestarted at [**Hospital **] rehab facility and pt had gross hematuria on\nadmission.  He had CT abdomen/pelvis in the ED which showed\nquestion of focal density in the bladder lumen, which is most\nlikely clot but raises concern for malignant lesion.  The\nurology service was consulted and recommended sending urine\ncytology and outpatient f/u with cystoscopy in [**12-25**] weeks after\ndischarge.  Urine cytology was negative for malignant cells.\n\n# Hemoptysis: Pt reported one episode of hemoptysis on the night\nprior to admission (approx 1 tbsp).  He did not have hemoptysis\nduring admission, and it was felt that this most likely occured\ndue to CHF exacerbation and anticoagulation.\n\n# Afib: CHADS2 score 6. Rate was well controlled on home\nmetprolol.  INR was therapeutic on admission but warfarin was\nheld for much of the admission while awaiting decisions on the\naortic valve proceudres and for placement of dialysis catheters.\n He was maintained on heparin IV during this time with PTT\n60-100. However, given concern for HITT later in hospital stay,\npatient was transitioned to argatroban infusion with the same\ntarget PTT.\n\n# Hypertension (HTN): Systolic blood pressures during admission\nwere ranging from 70s-90s even on intermittent HD.  This was\nfelt due to critical AS and heart failure as above.  His\nmetoprolol was held due to low pressures and he was started on\nmidodrine 10 mg MWF before HD sessions.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia (HLD): Continued Simvastatin\n# Diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DMT2): Diet controlled. Maintained\non sliding scale insulin in house.\n# GERD: Continued home Omeprazole\n# Hyperparathyroidism: Continued Calcitriol\n# Gout: Allopurinol held due to acute on chronic renal failure.\n# Insomnia/anxiety: Continued home Lorazapam 1mg HS PRN and\nquetiapine qhs.\n\nTransitional Issues:\nexpired\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1) Lasix 120mg [**Hospital1 **]\n2) Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID\n3) Simvastatin 40mg PO BID\n4) Flonase 50mcg 1 spray Daily\n5) Miralax 17gm daily\n6) Prilosec 20mg PO daily\n7) Senna 17.2mg PO daily\n8) Colace 200mg PO BID\n9) Renagel 1600mg PO TID with meals\n10) Allopurinol 150mg PO daily\n11) Aspirin 81mg PO daily\n12) Calcitriol 0.25mcg PO daily\n13) Warfarin 2mg daily\n\nDischarge Medications:\nexpired\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\nAcute on chronic systolic heart failure--EF 30%\nAortic stenosis\nAcute on chronic renal failure\nHematuria\n\nSecondary:\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nDischarge Condition:\nexpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nexpired\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nexpired\n\n\n\"\n52931,7522,178146,2199-07-12,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2199-7-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2199-7-12**]\n\n\nService:  MEDICINE\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 71329**] is a 76-year-old\ngentlemen with a history of coronary artery disease,\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, status post recent L3-S1\nlaminectomy who was in his usual state of health until the\nnight of admission when he had an episode of emesis after\ntaking his OxyContin medication.

His cirrhosis has been complicated by\nascites requiring repeated LVP (past 7 months), encephelopathy,\nSBP and HRS.  He was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] from\n[**Date range (1) 28235**] to the liver service for similiar complaints.

Was discharged off\ndiuretics given worsening renal function and concern for\nelectrolyte abnormalities. During the admission, his chronic\nhyponatremia worsened with administration of Bumex and\nspironolactone, and improved when these meds were held. Since\ndischarge, the patient has noted increasing abdominal girth,\nweight gain, and worsening fatigue. 1 day PTA, he presented to\n[**Hospital3 **] for repeat paracentesis.  There, he was noted to\nbe more edematous on exam.  Patient mentions that the edema has\nbeen getting progressively worse for the past several weeks.\nHis labs at [**Hospital1 **] were notable for hyponatremia with Na 116, WBC\n6.5, K 5.3, Cr 1.6, AST 36, ALT 35, Tbili 1.0, AP 212, TSH 3.98,\nAlbumin 3.1, lactate 1.4. Per report, ultrasound there did not\nshow any evidence of fluid ammenable to paracentesis. Was\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.\n\nIn the ED, initial VS were 99 81 107/36 14 96%. Labs notable for\nNa 114 (recent baseline 120-127), K 5.6, Cr 1.7 (recently\n1.4-1.5), ALT 39, AST 44, AP 197, Tbili 1.1, Alb 3.2, Hct 25.8\n(baseline 24-25), WBC 6.1 with 81.5% neutr. No imaging done\nhere. Patient received zofran for nausea. Liver consulted, who\nrecommended fluid restriction. Recommended albumin if worsening\nrenal failure, but as Cr 1.7 (which is near recent baseline), no\nalbumin given. Was admitted for further work-up and treatment of\nhyponatremia and cirrhosis. VS prior to transfer 97.8 76 103/36\n15 95%.\n\nOn the floor, the patient reports significant fatigue. He denies\nchest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea or lightheadness.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Recent diagnosis of cirrhosis in [**4-/2136**] in the setting of\nincreasing abdominal girth.

Nuclear report\nsent\nseparately.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n65 yo M w/ NASH cirrhosis h/o SBP and TIPS with recent revision,\nrefractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, who presented with\nlethargy and hyponatremia. Course complicated by HRS and\nmalnutrition. Approved for transplant waiting list during this\nadmission.\n\n# Hyponatremia: Presented with lethargy, sodium of 114,\nconcerning for an acute on chronic process, as his records\nindicate a baseline sodium level of 125-130. Due to [**Last Name (un) **] on prior\nadmission at [**Hospital1 18**] discharged [**7-10**], patient has not been on\ndiuretics.  Patient was started on hypertonic saline drip in the\nICU and improvement of Na to >120 was noted by hospital day 2\nand hypertonic saline was discontinued prior to transfer to the\nliver service. Renal was consulted, and he had a TSH and\ncortisol check, both of which were normal. Patient was managed\nwith fluid restriction and salt restriction. Sodium on discharge\nwas 133.\n- Continue to fluid restrict to 750cc/day, 2g Na restriction\n- Continue to hold diuretics for [**Last Name (un) **]\n\n#Renal Failure: Acute on Chronic renal failure from baseline Cr\nof 1.4. Likely HRS type 2 chronically, now exacerbated by HRS\nType I. Renal was consulted. Creatinine finally improved with\naggressive albumin resucitation and maximum doses of midodrine\nand octreotide. 24 hr urine collection showed CrCl 23 while\ncreatinine was still elevated. If renal function worsens again\nand cannot recover, may need repeat creatinine clearance, as if\nGFR <25 for 2 weeks he may be a candidate for combined\nliver-kidney transplant. At time of discharge patient was back\nto about baseline on midodrine alone.\n- Continue to hold diuretics\n- Continue midodrine 15mg TID PO\n- Follow up in transplant clinic as scheduled\n\n# Cirrhosis: NASH cirrhosis s/p TIPS, cirrhosis complicated by\nHE, SBP, HRS,  MELD on transfer from MICU was 20, decreased to\n15 at time of discharge. Patient approved for transplant waiting\nlist during this admission.\n- SBP: h/o SBP, neg diagnostic paracentesis x2 this admission,\non cipro ppx\n- Hepatic Encephalopathy: on lactulose, rifaximin. AMS resovled,\nno asterixis at discharge\n- Varices: None on OSH EGD, not on nadolol\n- Ascites: Off diuretics for HRS, fluid and Na restriction; TIPS\npatent on US [**2137-7-21**]\n- Patient will follow up in transplant clinic\n\n#Malabsorption: Severe nutritional deficiency as evidenced via\nphysical appearance of cachexia, bitemporal wasting, and albumin\nof 3.1. Pt currently on tube feeds [**12-20**] malabsorption in setting\nof NASH cirrhosis, gastric bypass surgery. He will need to be on\ntube feeds indefinitely. As pt has distorted anatomy due to\nroux-en-y gastric bypass, and will likely have recurrent large\nvolume ascites, a PEG tube is not a viable option for tube\nfeeds, so must use dobhoff. Nutrition was consulted, patientn\nwas on nepro tube feeds for hyperkalemia early in the admission,\ntransitioned back to isosource prior to discharge as was\nnormo-hypokalemic.\n- Continue tube feeds at home via dobhoff\n\n#DM: Sugars were difficult to control during this admission\nwhile on tubefeeds and octreotide was also likely contributing\nfactor. Was discharged on slightly increased basal insulin dose,\nand octreotide was not continued at discharge.\n- Instructed to follow up closely with PCP for diabetes\nmanagement\n\n# Falls: Patient had right arm pain and edema, ecchymosis s/p\nfall in transit to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH. No indwelling CVC to increase\nrisk of upper extremity DVT, plainfilm of R should without\nfracture or dislocation. Improved without intervention. Of note,\npatient also had a mechanical fall during this admission without\nloss of conciousness. He did not recall hitting his head but the\nfollowing day he was noted to have left eye scleral hemorrhage\nin addition to several new ecchymoses and lacerations.\nOphtomology consult was deferred as patient had normal EOM and\nno vision changes.\n\n# Troponemia: Obtained for unclear reasons during MICU work up,\nTrop-T 0.18 to 0.25 in setting of worsening renal function\nhowever in patient with known CAD s/p CABG. EKG with no ischemic\nchanges from prior.  Patient without chest pain and without\nevents on telemetry. Nuclear stress testing for transplant work\nup did not show any evidence of ischemic changes.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Cultures of peritoneal fluid from [**2137-7-30**] pending at discharge\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from PatientwebOMR.\n1.

His antihypertensives were\ninitially held, though they were restarted in the setting of his\nNSTEMI.  He was put on empiric ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and\nmetronidazole to cover both community-acquired and aspiration\nbacterial pathogens and has symptomatically improved.  A speech\nand swallow evaluation was concerning for esophageal dysphagia;\nsince this was known to be old by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], further\nevaluation was deferred for now; he was kept on a diet of ground\nsolids and thin liquids.  Prior to discharge, his antibiotic\nregimen was simplified to levofloxacin and metronidazole to\ncomplete a 10-day course.\n.\nOn admission, he was also found to have an NSTEMI with CKs\npeaking at [**2160**] in the setting of marked anterior ST depressions\nwhich subsequently improved; he was not heparinized due to his\nsupratherapeutic INR, and he was loaded with clopidogrel.  A TTE\nshowed a marked drop in his LVEF to 25% (from 71% on nuclear\nstress in [**10/2146**]) presumed secondary to ischemia.  In the\nsetting of this NSTEMI and also due to clinical volume overload,\nhe was diuresed with a series of Lasix boluses.  The MICU team\nchose to start him on Plavix to help maximize his medical\nmanagement.  A cardiology consultation was obtained; they\nrecommended adding an ACEi to help maximize his medical\nmanagement.  They also reviewed his cardiac cath report from\n[**1-/2148**] and recommended that he have a P-MIBI due to this new,\nlarge drop in his LVEF.  Per cardiology, even if he had a large\nreversible defect on his MIBI, his [**1-/2148**] cath report showed few\n(if any) options for potential further revascularization.  In\nlight of this, both the patient and his PCP chose to defer the\nMIBI at this time and maximize his medical management.\n.\nHe was on home warfarin given his recent diagnosis of pulmonary\nembolism.  On admission, however, he was noted to have a\nmarkedly elevated INR which was presumed to be due to his\nconcurrent antibiotic use.  His INR subsequently rose >9 and he\nwas given 2 units of FFP while in the MICU.  His warfarin was\ninitially held but, as his INR came down, he was restarted on a\nreduced dose (1mg) of warfarin.  On the day prior to discharge,\nhis INR dropped to 1.8, which is below therapeutic level; he was\nbridged with treatment-dose enoxaparin on that day and his INR\nwas 2.0 by the next day.\n.\nMr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be in acute-on-chronic renal failure\nupon admission.

GI consulted and performed an EGD which showed 2 grade II\nesophageal varices which were banded.  The gastric mucosa was\nconsistent with portal gastropathy but there was no active\nbleeding.  The patient also received Vitamin K for an elevated\nINR.  After the EGD, the patient's Hematocrit remained stable\nfor the duration of the hospitalization and there were no\nfurther signs of bleeding.  The patient was on IV Protonix [**Hospital1 **]\nduring the acute phase of the bleed.\n\n2. HCV Cirrhosis: During the hospitalization there was no\nevidence of fulminant hepatic failure or evidence of hepatic\nencephalopathy.  Nadolol was held until bleeding resolved and\nthen restarted.  Pt was also on ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis\nwhile in the hospital.  Lactulose was not continued since the\npatient did not display any signs of encephalopathy.\n\n3. ETOH abuse: Patient had mild withdrawl symptoms on admission.\n He was started on a valium CIWA scale.

Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes remain in\nposition.\n\nIMPRESSION: Interval increased opacification behind the heart\nconsistent with left basilar atelectasis or even pneumonia\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n.\n# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: In the ED she was found to be\nsomnolent with pinpoint pupils and a paCO2 of 91. She was given\nnarcan with no response. She was placed on BIPAP with worsening\nof her PaCO2 to 99. A CT Head was negative. She was intubated\nand subsequently admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. In\nthe ICU, pt was maintained on AC ventilation.  It was felt that\nthe patients respiratory failure was likely secondary to BiPap\nnon-compliance, as has had history of hypercapnic failure;\nPatient tolerated weaning off ventilator well, and was\nsuccessfully extubated with assistance of interventional\npulmonology on hospital day on [**11-29**] 07.  The patient was\ninitially started on antibiotics for a concern of pneumonia\n(Vanco/Azithro/Ceftriaxone) but this was discontinued on\nhospital day #4 as there was no growth on cultures.  Patient was\ncontinued on her CPAP both during the evening while sleeping and\nduring the day while napping. Pt was transferred to the floor on\n[**2119-11-30**].  She was continued on CPAP and did well throughout the\nrest of her stay.  A CPAP machine was ordered as well as home O2\nfor the patient upon discharge.\n.\n# Altered MS: Pt was initially unresponsive secondary to\nrespiratory failure, however this quickly improved.  She was at\nher baseline throughout the rest of her stay.  Social work, OT,\nand PT were all consulted concerning her dispo given that it was\nunclear if patient could care for herself at home.  PT did not\nfeel she required additional services. OT felt pt needed 24 hour\nmonitoring.  Case management discussed this with the daughter\nwho felt that she was able to take care of her at home 24 hours\nper day.  The patient and her daughter both did not want a rehab\nfacility or [**Hospital3 **] for the patient.\n.\n# Leukocytosis: Pt was initially febrile, had leukocytosis and a\nquestion of infiltrate on her CXR. Cultures showed gram stain\npositive for GP cocci and GN rods. She received a 4 day course\nof Vanc, Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone, discontinued after\ncultures showed no growth. Urine cultures and blood cultures\nalso showed no growth. Ultimately, her elevated WBC was felt to\nbe secondary to increased steroid dosing which was started for\npossible airway edema. Patients WBC trended down.  It rose on\nthe day of discharge however she was afebrile, asymptomatic and\na CXR and U/A were both negative.\n.\n# Edema: Patient has developed lower extremity edema, and\nreports often needing Lasix in the hospital for fluid balance.\nShe was given a few doses of Lasix, however when her Na rose\n(see below) the lasix was discontinued.\n.\n# Panhypopituitarism: THe patient was resumed on her home\nmedications onc eshe was extubated which included desmopressin\n0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 20 mg daily, and levothyroxine 125 mcg.\n.\n# Hypernatremia: Pt was hypernatremic during her admission.\nThis was thought to be due to poor PO intake.  Free water was\nencouraged.  She also received 2 boluses of D5.  Her sodium\nsubsequently improved and remained stable.\n.\n# Hypertension: Pt was continued on her home medication of\nValsartan 80 daily.  Her blood pressure remained elevated and\nMetoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was added.  This improved her BP control.\n.\n\n.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPotassium 20 mEq daily\n- Prednisone 20 mg daily\n- Diovan 80 mg daily\n- Desmopressin 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **]\n- Levoxyl 0.125 mg daily\n- Ipratropium Bromide 0.03%\n- ASA 81 mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Of note, she was recently\nadmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (2) 111100**] for acute dCHF, acute COPD\nand treated with diuresis and steroids with improvement in her\nsymptoms. She grew pan-resistant pseudamonas but was thought to\nbe a colonizer per ID c/s. She was discharged on a long steroid\ntaper, starting at prednisone 5 daily x 1 week, followed by\nprednisone 2.5 daily x 1 week, then to stop. She was still\ntaking 5 a day when her symtptoms began 3 days prior to\npresentation. She first noted increasing [**Date range (2) **] with heavy\ngreen/yellow sputum that was new. She also noted associated\ndyspnea worsening with the [**Date range (2) **]. Within 1-2 days prior to\npresentation she noticed increasing wheezing, orthopnea, mild\nweight gain (4lbs from 266->270lbs in 24 hours), pedal edema.\nShe also complained of generalized malaise and weakness. Due to\nthis constellation of symptoms, she decided to come to the ED\nfor further evaluation.\n.\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were 99  131/99  100  18  94%3L.\nShe was thought to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure\nrequiring bipap with her initial ABG 7.33/79/181. Repeat 1 hr\nafter bipap trial was 7.42.60/174 while on 2LNC. She was given 2\ndoses of albuterol nebulizer without clear improvement in her\nsymptoms, but it did lead to thick yellow sputum clearance. Her\npressures remained in the 90s/40s while on bipap. After bipap\nher pressures improved and she was given lasix 40mg IV ONCE for\npresumed pulmonary edema. She made approximately 300cc of urine\nafter this bolus. She had a foley and 1 20 gauge IV placed. Her\nlast set of vitals were 98.6  95  100/50  26  96%2LNC.\n.\nIn the MICU, she continued to have a heavy [**Date range (2) **] with heavy\nsecretions and remained mildly dyspneic and mildly tachypneic.\nShe also became hypotensive to the high 70s/40s, which responded\nto a 250cc bolus. She was started on vancomcyin, meropenem for\nHAP treatment, hydrocortisone for mild COPD flare and relative\nadrenal insufficiency, and kayaxalate for hyperkalemia. Bipap\nwas started overnight for her known OSA.\n.\nReview of systems:\n(+) Per HPI\n(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss.\nDenies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.\nDenies Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or focal\nweakness.

Please note that infection\nwithin the lung bases cannot be excluded on this exam.\nEnlargement of the hila\nbilaterally is suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial\nhypertension.\n\nCXR [**2198-8-18**]:\nCHEST: There has been no significant change since the prior\nchest x-ray of\n[**8-17**]. Bibasilar consolidations are again noted with bilateral\neffusions. Appearances are consistent with failure and possibly\nadditional pneumonia.\n\nIMPRESSION: No change. Failure and possible pneumonia.\n\n[**8-19**] CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST\nFINDINGS: there is a large nodule in the left lobe of the\nthyroid gland measuring 3.2 x 2.4 cm. This contains coarse\ncalficiations but is unchanged in appearance compared to the\nprior study. No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is seen.\nModerate atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and\ncoronary arteries is seen. Calcification of the mitral valve\nannulus is also noted. A left-sided subclavian line is in situ\nwith its tip at the distal SVC. The heart is moderately enlarged\nbut unchanged compared to the prior study. No axillary or\nmediastinal lymph nodes which meet the CT size criteria for\npathologic enlargement. There is a cluster of small mediastinal\nlymph nodes in a pretracheal and precarinal position (2:17, 10).\nThese are similar in appearance compared to the prior study.\nThere are bilateral small simple pleural effusions with\nassociated compressive atelectasis. There is near-complete\natelectasis of the left lower lobe. Assessment for associated\ninfection is limited by the lack of intravenous contrast. The\nmain pulmonary artery measures 4.6 cm, increased in size\ncompared to the prior study when it measured 4.2 cm. In addition\nthe right main pulmonary artery measures 3.4 cm, increased from\n2.9 cm and the left main pulmonary artery measures 3.1 cm,\nincreased from 2.7 cm. There is prominence of th intrapulmonary\nvasculature also consistent with the patient's known pulmonary\nhypertension. There is persistent bronchiectasis in the right\nupper lobe (2:21). This has not progressed compared to the prior\nstudy. No other focal abnormalities are seen. An endotracheal\ntube is in situ with its tip approximately 2cm proximal to the\ncarina. The airways are patent to subsegmental level. This study\ns\nnot tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic organs, only\nto note there is a small amount of perihepatic simple free\nfluid. An NG tube lies with its tip in the stomach. The right\nadrenal gland is unremarkable. The left adrenal gland is not\nclearly seen.\nBONY STRUCTURES: no destructive lytic or sclerotic bony lesions\nare seen.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Left lower lobe atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be\nexcluded.\n2. Persistent pulmonary hypertension with disease progression.\n3. Small bilateral pleural effusions not sufficient to account\nfor the left lower lobe atelectasis.\n4. Trace ascites.\n5. Cardiomegaly.\n6.

I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA\nregulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]\nthroughout the procedure. No TEE related complications. The\npatient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Resting tachycardia\n(HR>100bpm). Left pleural effusion.\nConclusions\nNo spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of\nthe left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right\natrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No\natrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The\nright ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free\nwall function. There are simple atheroma in the descending\nthoracic aorta 35 cm from the incisors. The number of aortic\nvalve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets\nare severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is\npresent (could not be quantified). Trace aortic regurgitation is\nseen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic\nregurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is\nmoderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+)\nmitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid\nregurgitation is seen.\n\nIMPRESSION: Significant calcific aortic stenosis (not\nquantified). Preserved left ventricular function. Dilated right\nventricle with borderline normal systolic function.\n\n[**2198-8-22**] TTE\nLEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Elongated LA.\n\nRIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter\nor pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.\nNormal IVC diameter (<=2.1cm) with <50% decrease with sniff\n(estimated RA pressure (5-10 mmHg).\n\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.\nOverall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal\nRV systolic function.\n\nAORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal\nascending aorta diameter.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Severely\nthickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area\n<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild\nmitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Moderate\nto severe [3+] TR. Severe PA systolic hypertension.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.\n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.\nConclusions\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.\nThe estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is\nmoderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\nventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular\ncavity is moderately dilated with borderline normal free wall\nfunction. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be\ndetermined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely\nthickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis\n(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid\nregurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Critical calcific aortic stenosis with mild aortic\nregurgitation. Moderate left ventricular symmetric hypertrophy\nwith preserved systolic function. Moderately dilated RV with\nborderline systolic function. Moderate to severe moderate\ntricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension.\n\nCompared with the prior report dated [**2198-7-27**] (images\nreviewed), the degree of aortic stenosis is now quantified and\nappears to be critical.\n\n[**2198-8-28**] CXR\nFINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no\nrelevant\nchange. Unchanged course and position of the left-sided PICC\nline. Unchanged cardiomegaly with signs of moderate pulmonary\nedema. Unchanged bilateral basal opacities, left more than\nright, that are probably atelectatic in origin. The presence of\nsmall pleural effusions cannot be excluded.

Respiratory failure: Patient presented initially to the ICU\nwith clinical and ABG evidence of hypercarbic respiratory\nfailure that improved with bipap however ultimately she\nnecessitated intubation. Etiology was ? multifactorial including\nHCAP (has history of mutliple recurrent PNA's, and both sputum\nand BAL grew out a resistant Pseudomonas, see below), pulmonary\nedema from severe AS (see below) and uncontrolled atrial\nfibrillation), and COPD exacerbation.\n\nShe was treated with IV diuresis and was about 13L negative\nthrough LOS; this was occasionally limited by low blood\npressures. She was treated with bronchodilators and steroids,\nwhich are currently being weaned off (currently at 20 mg daily,\nswitch to 10 mg daily on [**8-30**] for 3 days, and should go down to\n5mg indefinitely thereafter until Pulmonology f/u. Of note, pt\nis on Dapsone for PCP prophylaxis which could be stopped once pt\nis weaned down to 5mg daily Prednisone.\n\nMost importantly, while intubated pt had TEE (55%, significant\ncalcific AS, dilated RV with borderline systolic fxn, 1+ MR, 2+\nTR) and TTE (65-70%, critical AS, mild AR, RV as above, 3+ TR,\nsevere pulmHTN -> AS now critical) and pt then underwent cardiac\ncathterization which confirmed severe AS. Swan Ganz catheter was\nplaced which showed PCWP's in the 40's, and PAP 60/40, at which\npoint pt was started on IV Lasix gtt guided by Swan. She then\nunderwent aortic valvuloplasty which did improve her transaortic\ngradient from mid 50's to low 30's. She was diuresed with IV\nLasix gtt and was 13L negative by discharge and last measured\nPCWP was 14. She was also given 3d of Acetazolamide for elevated\nHCO3.\n\nPt was evaluated by Cardiology and CSurg for evaluated of aortic\nvalve replacement vs research protocol transarterial aortic\nvalve replacement. This workup was ongoing and pt has follow up\nscheduled for [**9-5**] with CSurg, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].\n\nPt was eventually weaned from ventilator and extubated without\ndifficulty. She was weaned down to 2L NC by discharge, and\nshould receive BiPAP at night. Her Lasix gtt was off by\ndischarge however she was discharged just before transitioning\nher to PO diuresis which she was taking before admission (60 mg\nin the am and 20 mg in the pm, and 50 mg daily Spironolactone).\nShe was placed back on torsemide prior to discharge. Patient\nwill need daily evaluation of fluid status with goal for further\ndiuresis of 1L if BP/HR tolerate and patient not symptomatic.\n\n2. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PNA: ID consulted, unclear if this was\ncolonization vs active PNA, however given pt with acute on\nchronic respiratory failure, ID was consulted and recommended\ntreatment with a 14d course of Merrem (was intermediate to\nMerrem and resistant to basically everything else). Her last\ndose of Merrem should be around 8pm of [**8-28**] which will be given\nat LTAC. She was also empirically treated with a course of\nVancomycin until her WBC count and Plts began to drop; at which\npoint this was stopped and only continued on Meropenem without\nany change in clincal status. A 14 day course of meropenem was\ncompleted at the recommendation of ID.\n\n3. Hypotension: Initially during presentation; this responded\nwith IVF's. This was early in her course and not further\nclinically relevant, she was never on pressors.\n\n4. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.8 on admission, up from\nbaseline of 1.2-1.3. Unclear etiology, possibly due to poor\nforward flow from severe AS. This improved slowly with diuresis\nand pt's Cr was 0.7-0.8 by discharge.\n\n5. Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled not on\nanticoagulation [**3-7**] bleed history. She was noted to have rapid\nventricular rate, and was initially on Diltiazem gtt that was\ntransition to oral Diltiazem which provided good rate control\nand should be continued. Continued on ASA 325mg daily. However,\nshe continued to have fast rates, requiring dilt gtt.\n\n6. OSA: Reports 100% adherence. She was given nocturnal BiPAP\nafter extubation.\n\n7. Leukopenia: This has been previously noted, with Heme Onc\nconsultation note in [**2193**]. Her WBC 4.7 on admission decreased to\ntrough of 1.5 which was thought possibly due to Vancomycin, and\nso this was stopped without any clinical deterioration and\nVancomycin was added to her allergy list for ? leukopenia and\nthrombocytopenia.\n\n8. Anemia: Hct 31.4 on admission trended down through admission\nto 26.9 on discharge. She was not transfused. Iron studies\nconsistent with iron deficiency anemia however supplementation\nwas deferred to outpatient providers. Of note patient had\nheme-positive stool throughout admission.\n\n9. Thrombocytopenia: Plts 170 on admission, trended down to 135\nthrough admission, possibly also thought due to Vancomycin. On\ndischarge, plts remained 135.\n\n10. Follow up issues: She will need to follow up with Cardiology\n(Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]), CSurg (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], Pulmonology (has not\nseen in 1.5 yrs due to cancelling appts), Sleep medicine (Dr.\n[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4507**])\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. ferrous sulfate 300 mg (60 mg iron) Tablet Sig: One (1)\nTablet PO BID (2 times a day).\n2.

You came in to [**Hospital1 18**] for\nincrease in SOB and respiratory distress. You had to be\nintubated (have a tube placed to help you breath). Your\nrespiratory failure was thought to be due to numerous causes:\nCOPD, heart failure, valve stenosis and pseudomonas pneumonia.\nYou were treated for all of these with antibiotics for the\npneumonia, IV lasix (diuretics) for  your heart failure and you\nalso had a balloon valvuloplasty for your aortic valve stenosis.\nYou are also in the process of being evaluated by\ncardio-thoracic surgery for possible valve replacement surgery.\nYou have done well and you were able to be extubated with no\ncomplications. You are now breathing more comfortable on [**3-8**]\nLiters of oxygen via nasal canula. You will need to have\nfollow-up appointments with the cardio-thoracic surgeon and\npulmonologist as listed below.\n\nThe following changes were made to your medications:\n- Meropenem 1000 mg IV every 8 hours (last dose tonight on\n[**8-28**])\n- Restart Torsimide home dose 60mg every AM and 20mg every PM,\nstart tomorrow and adjust as needed\n- Spirolactone 50mg orally daily\n- Dapsone until prednisone is [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] down to 5mg daily then stop\n- Diltiazem changed from 240mg Extended release daily to 60 mg\nPO/NG TID (it may be increase as tolerated)\n- Start on insulin, Humolog Sliding scale while on prednisone\n- Prednisone 20mg orally until [**8-29**], then decrease to 10mg for\n3 days (from [**Date range (1) 111101**]) and 5mg daily (from [**9-2**])\n\nWeigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more\nthan 3 lbs.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: CARDIAC SURGERY\nWhen: TUESDAY [**2198-9-4**] at 3:00 PM\nWith: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 177**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**]\nBuilding: LM [**Hospital Unit Name **] [**Location (un) 551**]\nCampus: WEST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name **] Garage\n\nDepartment: ADULT SPECIALTIES, Pulmonologist\nWhen: WEDNESDAY [**2198-10-17**] at 4:20 PM\nWith: [**Doctor First Name **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1142**]\nBuilding: [**Location (un) 2355**] ([**Location (un) **], MA) [**Location (un) 551**]\nCampus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: Parking on Site\n\nDepartment: ADULT SPECIALTIES\nWhen: THURSDAY [**2198-12-20**] at 3:30 PM\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1523**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1142**]\nBuilding: [**Location (un) 2355**] ([**Location (un) **], MA) [**Location (un) 551**]\nCampus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: Free Parking on Site\n\n\n                             [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(1) 292**]\n\nCompleted by:[**2198-8-28**]\"\n49573,6710,154121,2139-04-06,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2139-3-27**]     Discharge Date:\n\nDate of Birth:                  Sex:  F\n\nService:\n\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:\n1.

Left subclavian artery stent.\n4.  Aortofemoral bypass.\n5.  Left renal artery stent\n\nMEDICATIONS AT TIME OF ADMISSION:\n1.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n2.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.\n3.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. daily.\n4.  Aspirin 81 mg daily.\n5.  Lipitor 40 mg daily.\n6.  Isosorbide dinitrate 30 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n7.  Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. daily.\n8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. daily.\n9.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily.\n10. Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q. h.s.\n\nALLERGIES:  Patient had no known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient had a 30-pack-year smoking history\nand quit three years prior to admission.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake and alert.  Temperature\n98.3, heart rate 54, blood pressure 120/76, respiratory rate\n14, satting 93% on room air.  Her HEENT exam demonstrates her\nhead to be normocephalic and atraumatic with her extraocular\nmuscles intact and anicteric sclerae and a left carotid\nbruit.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Her lungs are\nclear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart sounds are regular\nin rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop\nappreciated.  The abdomen is soft, obese, nontender,\nnondistended.  There is trace edema noted.\n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell\ncount of 5.6, hematocrit 34.5, platelets of 170, sodium of\n144, potassium of 4.3, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 28,\nBUN of 40, creatinine of 2.7, and glucose of 99.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 64-year-old female with a\nhistory of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular\ndisease with a demonstrated brachiocephalic artery occlusion\nwho is now presenting for elective bypass of this occlusion.\n\nPatient was admitted, placed on a Heparin drip with a\nCardiology evaluation, and preoperative clearance given.  She\nwas taken to the Operating Room on [**2139-3-30**] when the bypass\nwas performed without incident.  Patient had Dopplerable\ntriphasic brachial, radial, and ulnar pulses postoperatively.\nShe was in the Cardiothoracic Surgery Intensive Care Unit\npostoperatively.\n\nHer postoperative course was initially stable.  She was\nweaned off of her pressors and continued on antibiotics.\n\nBy postoperative day number two she had been extubated and\nwas neurologically intact and transferred to the Vascular\nIntermediate Care Unit.  A Physical Therapy consultation was\nobtained for postoperative recovery.  Patient was resumed on\nher Coumadin as well as her preadmission medication regimen.\nOf note, the patient developed atrial fibrillation on\n[**2139-4-1**] which was rate controlled with Lopressor.  Her\nAmiodarone dose was increased and this continued to control\nher rate.\n\nPatient, on the evening of [**2139-4-4**], developed respiratory\ndistress and arrest which led to a cardiac arrest.  She was\nemergently intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care\nUnit.\n\nDuring the code she developed asystole.  Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation was initiated and tracings at that time showed\nfine ventricular fibrillation.  She was successfully\ndefibrillated and developed an organized rhythm.  Her EKG\ndemonstrated diffuse ST segment ischemic changes.  Her blood\npressure returned to 110/68 and she was seen by the\ncardiologist.\n\nThe patient required Dopamine drip to maintain her blood\npressure which was changed to Levophed.  She underwent a\nbronchoscopy which demonstrated some areas of atelectasis but\notherwise without acute pathology.\n\nA PA catheter was placed which initially was unable to be\nwedged but demonstrated a central venous pressure of 15, PA\npressures of 35/12, and a cardiac output and index of 4.8 and\n1.9, respectively.  The SVR was 833 at that time and the\nLevophed drip was running at 0.02 mcg/kg per minute at that\ntime.\n\nA TEE was emergently performed which demonstrated normal\nbiventricular function and no evidence of dissection.  A\nchest x-ray that had been done at the time of the code\ndemonstrated left basilar collapse, for which the\nbronchoscopy was performed.\n\nThe patient was continued on her Heparin with full supportive\nIntensive Care Unit care.  However, after extensive\ndiscussions with the family members it was decided that the\npatient would no longer want to have full supportive care\ngiven her grave prognosis following her cardiopulmonary\narrest.  With this in mind the family made a decision to not\nhave the patient undergo any additional diagnostic testing or\ntherapeutic interventions.  They requested that the level of\nsupport not be escalated or withdrawn, that is, that her\ncurrent level of support that was being delivered on\n[**2139-4-5**] be continued without change.\n\nPatient remained comfortable and became asystolic on the\nmorning of /  / and was pronounced by the Intensive Care Unit\nteam at that time.  The medical examiner was notified by the\nIntensive Care Unit team.\n\n\n\n\n                          [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 3409**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 96566**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2139-4-6**]  08:49\nT:  [**2139-4-6**]  10:22\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 103685**]\n\"\n48498,2301,149119,2105-12-25,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2105-12-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2105-12-25**]\n\nDate of Birth:   [**2037-2-2**]       Sex:  M\n\nService:  [**Hospital1 **]\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 68-year-old male\nwith long standing tobacco use greater than 100 pack year who\npresented with shortness of breath for about one day prior to\nadmission.

No acute focal pneumonia. On\nthe lateral view, there appears to be some opacification in the\nretrocardiac area. However, some of this may be merely due to\noverlying soft tissues. In view of the clinical history, the\npossibility of a region of pneumonia cannot be excluded.\n\n[**2156-12-10**] Left wrist x-ray: Soft tissue calcifications and\nswelling overlying the radial aspect of the distal radius are\ngrossly stable since [**2156-3-3**]. The scapholunate interval again\nmeasures 3 mm. Diffuse osteopenia is unchanged. Lucencies are\nnoted within the capitate and scaphoid which are grossly stable.\nThere is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.\nIMPRESSION: Stable exam without evidence of acute process\n\n[**2156-12-11**] Right shoulder x-ray: No previous images. Three views\nshow loss of the cortical margin involving the distal clavicle\nwith widening of the acromioclavicular joint. Suggestion of an\nassociated soft tissue prominence. In view of the clinical\nhistory, the possibility of a septic arthritis with\nosteomyelitis must be seriously considered.\n\n[**2156-12-12**] CT head (prelim report): No evidence of acute\nintracranial abnormality seen on non-contrast head CT, although\nfor more sensitive evaluation for subtle intracranial infection\nor small acute infarct, MRI would be recommended for more\nsensitive evaluation. Diffuse small lucencies in the calvarium,\nparticularly along the vertex, without cortical breakthrough or\ncortical thickening likely relates to chronic renal\nfailure/renal osteodystrophy, less likely Paget's disease or\ndiffuse metastatic disease.\n\n[**2156-12-13**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is\nmild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity\nsize and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The\nestimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling\npressure (PCWP>18mmHg).The estimated cardiac index is normal\n(>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is markedly\ndilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is\nabnormal septal motion/position consistent with right\nventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is\nmoderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There\nis a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. Compared with\nthe report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of\n[**2148-9-20**], the right ventricular cavity dilation and\nmoderate/severe PA systolic hypertension are new. The\npericardial effusion is likely similar.\n\n[**2156-12-13**] Portable abdomen:Non-specific bowel gas pattern without\nevidence for obstruction or ileus. No intraperitoneal free air.\n\n[**2156-12-13**] MRI head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or\ninfarction. There is no evidence of mass effect. There are no\ndiffusion abnormalities detected, that would be suggestive of\nseptic emboli. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber\nand configuration. There is noted to be fluid in the left\npetrous apex. There are a few small hyperintense foci seen in\nthe white matter on FLAIR images that are non specific in nature\nand demonstrate no restricted diffusion. The patient is noted to\nbe status post lens replacement on the right eyeglobe. In\ncomparison to the CT scan from [**2156-12-12**] the diffuse patchy and\nsmall rounded lucencies in the calvarium are not well\ndemonstrated on this current MR study. The basilar artery is\nnoted to be small in diameter. There is noted to be opacity\nwithin the mastoid air cells suggestive of fluid in the\nmastoids. This could be suggestive of mastoiditis. IMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence for septic emboli or abscess. No acute infarction\nor hemorrhage. 2. Areas of rounded lucencies within the\ncalvarium are not well demonstrated on this current MR study.\nPlease refer to CT report from [**2156-12-12**] for full\ncharacterization. 3. There is noted to be fluid in the left\npetrous apex.\n\n[**2156-12-14**] Upper GI Endoscopy: Findings: Esophagus: Normal\nesophagus. Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema and congestion of the\nmucosa were noted in the whole stomach. Cold forceps biopsies\nwere performed for histology at the stomach antrum.  Duodenum:\nMucosa: Erythema, congestion and friability of the mucosa with\nno bleeding were noted in the duodenal bulb compatible with\nduodenitis.  Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding, clean\nbased, small ulcers were found in the duodenal bulb.\nImpression: Ulcers in the duodenal bulb. Erythema, congestion\nand friability in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.\nErythema and congestion in the whole stomach (biopsy) Otherwise\nnormal EGD to third part of the duodenum.\n\n[**2156-12-14**] Pathology: Gastric Tissue Sample: Regeneration of\ngastric pits suggestive of chemical gastropathy.\n\n[**2156-12-14**] EKG: Primarily atrial fibrillation although there appear\nto be some flutter waves in leads V1-V2. Non-specific\nintraventricular conduction delay. Left anterior  fascicular\nblock. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy. Consider prior\nlateral myocardial infarction. Non specific ST-T wave changes.\nCompared to the previous tracing of [**2156-12-14**] the rhythm is more\nirregular consistent with atrial fibrillation.\n\n[**2156-12-14**] U/S of L AV fistula: Widely patent left brachial and\nleft radial arteries with suggestion of some degree of\natherosclerotic disease. Widely patent radiocephalic fistula\nwithout visualized stenosis of the outflow vein which appears to\nbe the cephalic vein.\n\n[**2156-12-16**]: MRI of the R hip: There is small amount of joint fluid\nin the right hip, which is in the range for physiological\nquantity. There are degenerative changes in the right hip which\ninclude subchondral cystic changes in the femoral head. A\nsubchondral cystic change is also noted in the femoral head-neck\njunction. Given the superior joint space narrowing, the\nappearance favors degenerative changes. However, less likely\ninfection may also produce this appearance. Infection is\nconsidered less likely due to lack of joint fluid.\nThere is a lobulated bright T2 signal intensity lesion adjacent\nto the superior labrum measuring 2.8 x 2.0 cm, which is most\nconsistent with a paralabral cyst. The labrum is not well\nassessed on this non-dedicated examination.\nThere is fluid signal intensity which spans 10 cm along the\ngreater trochanteric bursa, and measures 5.8 x 1.6 cm in axial\ndimensions, with appearance consistent with right greater\ntrochanteric bursitis. Degenerative changes are also noted in\nthe left hip. There is physiological joint fluid in the left\nhip. A tiny amount of fluid is also noted in the left greater\ntrochanteric bursa, consistent with mild bursitis.\nThere is diffuse soft tissue edema. There is edema in the right\nhemipelvis greater than left hemipelvis musculature,\nparticularly in the iliacus and gluteus minimus.\nIMPRESSION:\nPhysiological quantity of right hip joint fluid. Insufficient\nfluid for aspiration.   Greater trochanteric bursitis, right\nside significantly greater than left. Presence of a paralabral\ncyst suggests a superior labral tear, but the exact tear this is\nnot optimally seen due to lack of dedicated technique. Muscular\nedema as detailed.\n\n[**2156-12-18**]: CT Guided Biopsy: 25 cc of red serosanguineous colored\nfluid was aspirated with no complication fluid was sent for\nmicrobiologic examination. Culture:  GRAM STAIN 4+(>10 per 1000X\nFIELD): POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES. NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.\nFLUID CULTURE (Final [**2156-12-21**]):    NO GROWTH.\n\n[**2156-12-21**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular\nresponse. Occasional ventricular premature beats. Compared to\nthe previous tracing of [**2156-12-16**] ectopy is new.\n\n[**2156-12-21**]: CT of the torso, abdomen and pelvis to r/o occult\nabscess: 1. Mild pulmonary edema and background nodular and\ncystic changes, again concerning for LIP (lymphocytic\ninterstitial pneumonitis).   2. Unchanged marked cardiomegaly\nand small-to-moderate-sized pericardial effusion. 3. Small\nsplenic infarct, age indeterminate due to lack of prior\nexaminations. 4. No evidence of intrathoracic or intra-abdominal\nabscess.\n\n[**2156-12-22**] TEE: Conclusions  The left atrium is dilated. No\nspontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the\nleft atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic\nfunction is normal (LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the\naortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending\nthoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly\nthickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic\nvalve. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased\ntransaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.\nMild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic\nregurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmoderately thickened.There are torn, calcified mitral chordae\nseen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but\ncannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There\nis severe mitral annular calcification. Two eccentric (anterior\nand posterior directed) jets of mitral regurgitation are seen\nwith moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (3+) . A small\nperforation of the posterior leaflet cannot be excluded on the\nbasis of this study. No masses or vegetations are seen on the\ntricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic\nvalve. There is a small pericardial effusion.\nImpression: No valvular vegetations seen. Moderate to severe,\neccentric mitral regurgitation.\n\n[**2156-12-23**]: CT of the L wrist: Innumerable lucencies are seen\nthroughout the carpus. This includes large ill-defined lucencies\nin the scaphoid, lunate, capitate, hamate, trapezium,\ntriquetrum, and the bases of the metacarpals particularly the\nsecond through fourth metacarpals. Numerous irregular lucencies\nand areas of cortical destruction are also seen in the distal\nulna. There is extensive atherosclerotic vascular calcification.\nGas is seen within the dorsal soft tissues at the level of the\nwrist likely related to previous incision and drainage. The\nabsence of intravenous contrast severely limits evaluation for\nan underlying fluid collection, although no discrete soft tissue\ndensity is identified. Circumferential soft tissue edema is seen\nthroughout the subcutaneous and deep fat as well as associated\nskin thickening. Tendons are suboptimally assessed.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Innumerable lucencies throughout the carpus, distal ulna, and\nthe bases of the metacarpals as described could reflect an\nerosive process such as amyloidosis. However, given the history\nand the destructive and ill-defined appearance of these\nlucencies, the possibility of superimposed osteomyelitis is\ndifficult to exclude.\n2. No discrete soft tissue collection, although evaluation is\nsuboptimal due to the absence of intravenous contrast.\n3. Post-surgical changes including gas in the dorsal soft\ntissues of the wrist.\n\n[**2156-12-29**] EKG: Sinus rhythm and occasional ventricular ectopy.\nA-V conduction delay. Left atrial abnormality. Right\nbundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of\n[**2156-12-20**] sinus rhythm has appeared.\n\n[**2156-12-31**] CXR: Comparison is made to the prior chest x-ray of\n[**12-13**]. The heart remains enlarged. Some pulmonary\nplethora is present suggesting incipient failure. No areas of\npneumonia are seen. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild failure\n\n[**2157-1-2**] MRI right hip:\n1. Interval increase in the amount of right hip joint fluid, now\nlarge in quantity.\n2. More conspicuous signal changes in the right femoral head and\nneck and diaphysis, likely representing components of mild\nmarrow edema and hematopoietic marrow.\n3. Persistent, but slightly decreased, right greater\ntrochanteric bursitis.\n4. Persistent, and slightly increased, diffuse muscle edema as\ndetailed.\n\n[**2157-1-6**] CXR\n1) Marked cardiomegaly consistent with polychamber enlargement\nand/or an element of pericardial fluid.\n2) Diffusely increased interstitial markings consistent with\ninterstitial edema or another interstial process, (Please note\nthat the report from the [**2156-12-21**] CT scan also raised concern\nfor a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis.)\n2) Compared with [**2156-12-31**] and allowing for technical\ndifferences, the interstitial markings are without significant\ninterval change. No pleural effusion.\n\nLeft-Wrist x-ray [**2157-2-11**]:\nDiffuse osteoporosis is again seen, worse than on the prior\noccasion. Soft tissue vascular calcification is again seen, and\nalso is present on the thenar aspect of the forearm. No definite\nareas of bony destruction are seen; though, there is some\nirregularity at the distal aspect of the scaphoid on the thenar\naspect. These films should be compared with the MR films by\nmusculoskeletal radiologist.\n\nCT abd/pelvis [**2157-2-13**]:\n1. Small pelvic fluid collections noted on prior studies are\nless conspicuous on current study. No drainable fluid\ncollections are identified within the pelvis, although\nevaluation limited given streak artifact from right hip\narthroplasty.\n2. Little change to stranding and fluid within the region of the\nright gluteal musculature after hip arthroplasty.\n3. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.\nSmooth septal\nthickening within the bases again may represent pulmonary edema\nsuperimposed on previously described lymphocytic interstitial\npneumonitis (LIP).\n4. Cardiomegaly with mitral annular calcifications. Significant\ncalcifications within the SMA as detailed above.\n5. Splenomegaly.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n\"\"Brief\"\"\nThis is a 59 year old male with ESRD on HD with persistent\nfevers despite appropriate IV abx for MSSA+ bacteremia and\nlikely endocarditis following septic arthritis of left wrist s/p\nwash-out.\n\n# Fever: Vancomycin and gentamycin started empirically for joint\naspirate consistent with septic arthritis. Patient taken to OR\nby plastic reconstructive surgery for wash-out of left wrist.\nBlood cultures and fluid cultures subsequently grew out S.\naureus, and gentamycin discontinued. MSSA by [**Last Name (LF) 101016**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]\nvancomycin switched to nafcillin for better coverage, then to\ncefazolin with hemodialysis. Drainage from left wrist noted to\nbe less purulent and less erythematous per PRS evaluation.\nHowever, as Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to spike fevers with\npersistently positive cultures, ID consulted and recommended\nrestarting on nafcillin. Pt continued spiking fevers although\ncultures cleared [**12-12**]. Gentamicin with HD started for synergy.\nConcern for endocarditis as pt with murmur at baseline and new\nafib but no vegetations seen. No evidence of septic emboli on CT\nand MRI head. X-ray to evaluate for right shoulder infection\nwith absent cortex likely [**3-14**] old trauma - pt later noted pain\nold. Ultrasound of fistula with no evidence of infection.\n\nPt with pain on mobilization of R hip, concern for septic joint.\nMRI with no evidence of hip joint involvement but showed fluid\ncollection at tronchanteric bursa (culture negative), labral\ntear, muscle tear, improved with steroid injection. Left wrist\nre-aspirated and showed rare S. aureus. Wrist re-imaged with CT\nwithout significant fluid collection. TEE to re-evaluate for\nvegetations showed increased mitral regurgitation with 2 jets\nconcerning for valve perforation as well as new aortic\nregurgurgitation, both consistent with likely endocarditis. CT\nsurgery consulted and recommended surgery. Fevers continued\nintermittently (at least 1 every 24hrs) along w/ development of\nnight sweats until [**12-27**].  Concern for nafcillin-related drug\nfever, and patient switched to vancomycin with HD. Afebrile from\nlate [**12-27**] to [**12-30**], and Gentamicin discontinued. However,\ncontinued to spike fevers on vancomycin and switched back to\nbeta-lactam for better coverage of MSSA but still continued to\nspike fevers.\n\nTreated for 8 wks w/ cefazolin for IE and wrist osteomyelitis.\nWas temporarily afebrile, then broke R hip had hemiarthroplasty,\ngot ischemic colitis and hemicolectomy w/ ostomy. Ostomy leaked\ninto hip wound which became infected w/ enterobacter and\nKlebsiella sensitive to cipro. Initially afebrile after starting\ncipro and washing out hip. ID recommended continuing cipro for 6\nmonths because of concern for infected prosthesis though ortho\nsaid it was an infected hematoma. Recommended switching to\ncefepime if he spiked a fever through the cipro. Over the\nweekend of [**2-12**] and [**2-13**], the patient continued to spike low grade\nfevers. Out of concern for continuuing infection, the patient\nreceived a CT of the abd/pelvis on [**2157-2-13**]. This showed several\nfluid collections and possibly a larger hematoma at the right\nhip joint. The patient then had an IR guided drainage of fluid.\nThe hematoma near the joint did not aspirate and 100cc of fluid\ncollection near the staples was sampled. This fluid subsequently\ngrew VRE. It was determined the patient would need a Girdlestone\nprocedure in which the hardware of the right hip is removed and\nreplaced with a spacer so the area could be sterilized before\nreinserting hardware. The patient went for this procedure on\n[**2157-2-19**]. Post-op, the patient had a large amount of bloody\ndrainage from the wound vac and did requires an additional 10\nunits of pRBC's. After a brief stay in the MICU, the patient was\ncalled out to the floor where he remained stable.\n\n# Confusion: Pt initially delirious in setting of persistently\npositive blood cultures and continuing fevers, improved back to\nbaseline 5-6d later when no longer bacteremic and fevers running\nlower and more infrequent. Likely also to be more sensitive to\nnarcotics base on past response, per daughter. Of note, no acute\nintracranial process on CT or MRI head. RPR neg. B12 wnl. TSH\nelevated but T3 low, T4 wnl, likely euthyroid sick. Uremia\nunlikely as lytes at baseline on HD. Now resolved and remains\nAAO x 3 on discharge.\n\n# Cardiac dysarrhythmia: On admission, EKG regular with\nprolonged PR, unchanged from baseline. However, pt developed\nAfib and occasional aflutter during hospital course. Initially\nwith RVR then associated with bradycardia into HR 30s-40s.\nEvaluated by cardiology, who recommended anticoagulation with\ncoumadin and cardioversion. However, pt was not candidate at\nthat time as with new GI bleed, in which setting ASA also\ndiscontinued. Pt remained hemodynamically stable. Now in Afib.\nWould consider anticoagulation in the future if bleed is no\nlonger a concern.\n\n# Cardiac/valvular disease: TTE on [**2156-12-13**] without vegetations,\ntrivial MR, no AI, normal EF. TEE on [**2156-12-12**] to re-evaluate for\nvegetations showed increased mitral regurgitation w/ 2 jets\nconcerning for valve perforation as well as new aortic\nregurgurgitation, both consistent with endocarditis. Restarted\non ACE I to decrease afterload. Evaluated by CT surgery who\nrecommended mitral and aortic replacement. Decision made by pt\nand medical teams to defer in setting of acute infection while\naware that delay would increase risk of complications from\nongoing medical issues. Prior to surgery, pt will require cath\nand dental clearance. At the time of surgery, a bypass will\nlikely be needed with renal transplant should follow. CT surgery\nwill remain in contact with the patient, scheduled to follow up\nwith Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**2157-1-18**]. Pt. remained in house [**3-14**]\ncomplicated complications and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] saw him again in house\nand recomended no valve surgery unless would go for renal\ntransplant, also too debilitated w/ infectious processes going\non [**2158-2-9**]. He was also given multiple blood transfusions out\nof concern for demand ischemia.\n\n# Elevated troponin: Likely baseline in setting of renal failure\nalthough with transient worsening probably [**3-14**] to high output in\nsetting of infection. Sharp chest pain noted on several\noccassions throughout stay, thought to be related to anxiety and\ndemand ischemia from MR, AI, and anemia. No EKG changes\nappreciated with any episode; trop at baseline. Pain resolved\neach time within several minutes and responded well to\nnitroglycerin SL.\n\n# CHF: Pt with chronic diastolic CHF and history of systolic CHF\n(thought to be hypertensive cardiomyopathy) resolved on TTE in\n[**2152**] but continued on digoxin and euvolemic on admission. As TTE\non this admission also showed normal EF and as digoxin levels\ntoxic in setting of delirium, digoxin discontinued; continued on\nbeta blocker. As pt complaining of increased angina, restarted\non ACE-I for afterload reduction. Repeat TTE after the diagnosis\nof endocarditis with new finding of focal inferior wall motion\nabnormality with EF of 45%, likely in setting of increased\nvalvular disease v. ischemic change. The patient was restarted\non digoxin. His Ace-I has since been discontinued and he is\nbeing discharged on 12.5mg PO BID of Metoprolol.\n\n# HTN: Continued on metoprolol. Initially held moexipril,\nclonidine, and minoxidil as blood pressures lower running. As\nthese normalized, pt restarted on ACE-I (lisinopril) for\nafterload reduction in setting of increased angina, though this\nis now discontinued again. He is on Metoprolol for improved rate\ncontrol of afib as we are currently unable to anticoagulate him.\n\n# Anemia: Patient was admitted w/ Hct of 38.5 which slowly\ntrended down over admission to a low of 19.4. Anemia thought to\nbe of combined etiology including GI bleed, frequent blood\ndraws, anemia of chronic disease (as supported by Fe studies),\nand ESRD (on Epogen w/ HD).  Patient transfused with HD as Hct\ndropped into low 20s as developed more frequent episodes CP and\nSOB, likely exacerbated by valvular damage [**3-14**] endocarditis. The\npatient is currently guaiac negative but if Hct continues to\ntrend down, may need outpt colonoscopy. Hct should be monitored\non discharge, even after his hip wound ceases to drain.\n\n# Guaiac positive stools: Patient complained of abdominal\ntenderness on [**12-12**] exam with voluntary guarding. LFTs wnl and\nKUB unremarkable, date of last bowel movement unclear. Pt with\none large episode melanic stool on [**12-14**], EGD showed nonbleeding\nduodenol ulcers, duodenitis. Pt started on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and home ASA\nheld. Stools no longer guaiac positive except in setting of\nnosebleed, now again resolving.\n\n# Ischemic colitis: Pt complained of increasing abdominal pain\nduring his HD session on [**1-13**]. Abdominal exam without guarding\nor rebound but concern as pt appeared unwell, worsened from\nbaseline. Found to have ischemic colitis on stat CT. Surgery\nconsulted and pt taken to OR for left hemicolectomy and\ntransferred to the SICU afterwards. Post-op course notable for\nsome hypotension requiring blood transfusion and pressors.\nHowever, remaining bowel appeared pink and no further bowel\nresection required, and pt underwent abdominal closure,\nileostomy, Gtube placement on [**1-16**]. Extubated without difficulty\non [**1-17**]. Of note, wound vac placed on abdominal wound for caudal\naspect opening on [**1-25**]. The abdominal wound vac should be\nreplaced every 3 days until it can be discontinued.\n\n# ESRD on HD: Patient s/p failed transplant, on transplant list\nagain. Between HD sessions, pt developed increased JVD and\nbibasilar rales but breathing comfortably and satting well. Does\nnot produce urine at baseline. Continued on HD MWF, home meds,\nmedications renally dosed.\n\n# Right shoulder pain: Pt complaining of right shoulder pain on\nmovement, concern for septic involvement initially. Xray showed\ncortical absence at distal cortex, c/w old trauma v. infection.\nHowever, as patient without point tenderness and no signs of\ninflammation, low suspicion for infection. On further\nquestioning, pt reports having had pain on and off for few weeks\nprior to presentation; per pt, it is possible he has sustained\ntrauma to that shoulder.\n\n# Right hip fracture happened after bumping right knee on bed\nrail on [**2157-1-10**]. Taken to the operating room on [**2157-1-11**] and\nunderwent an right hip hemiarthroplasty.  Unfortunately found to\nhave same hip dislocated on [**2157-1-25**].  Returned to the operating\nroom on [**2157-1-26**] and underwent a revision of his right\nhemiarthroplasty.  He was found to have Enterococcus growing\nfrom his wound on [**2157-2-17**].  He was taken back to the OR for\nremoval of the hardware on [**2157-2-18**].  At that time he was\ncoagulopathic with an INR of 1.8  He was transfered to the MICU\nfollowing the procedure as he became hypotensive.  He was found\nto have profound blood loss into his hip joint.  He was\ntransfused a total of 10 units of PRBCs and 10 units of FFP at\ntaht time and 2 additional units of PRBCs the following day.  He\nwas stablized and monitored in the ICU until [**2157-2-22**] when he was\ntaken back to the OR for washout.  He was found to have VRE in\nthe wound and treated with daptomycin and ciprofloxacin.  He was\nthen transfered to the floor on the night of [**2157-2-22**].\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNephrocaps daily\nClonidine 0.1 mg daily\nDigoxin 125 mcg every other day and 250mcg every other day\nMoexipril 15 mg in the morning and 30mg in the evening\nMetoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nMinoxidil 5 mg daily\nLorazepam or valium at night\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Methicillin-sensitive staph aureus septicemia with confirmed\nL septic wrist and highly probable bacterial endocarditis.\n2. New mod/severe mitral regurgitation w/ perforation of the\nposterior leaflet and mild/moderate aortic insuffiency.\n3. New onset atrial fibrillation.\n4. Duodenal ulcers.\n5. ESRD, hemodialysis dependent.\n6. L hip bursitis.\n7. Febrile-associated delirium.\n8. Possible nafcillin related drug fever.\n9. Right femoral neck fracture, status-post girdlestone\nprocedure\n10. Adrenal Nodule, likely adenoma\n11. Non-ST Segment Myocardial Infarction\n12. Vancomycin Resistent Enterococcus infection.\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nStable. afebrile.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted with an infected left wrist, which was\nsurgically cleaned.  The wrist and your blood cultures contained\nbacteria, and therefore you were started on IV antibiotics.\nThese were changed several times during your stay here to\nspecifically target the bacteria.  Despite these antibiotics,\nyou remained febrile for several weeks and we were concerned for\ninfection in other parts of your body.  Imaging of your heart\nshowed evidence of infection, including new valve damage to your\nmitral and aortic valves.  This makes it harder for your heart\nto pump blood forwards and may require replacement of your heart\nvalves at a future date.  In addition, during your stay, you\nwere noted to have blood in your stool, found to be the result\nof ulcers in your duodenum. You received several blood\ntransfusions during your hospital course.\n\nWhile you were here, you broke your right hip and received a hip\nreplacement. Following this, you had ischemic colitis requiring\na hemicolectomy with ostomy placement. Subsequently, it was\nfound that your hip wound grew Klebsiella and Enterobacter. You\nwere treated for these but continued to have low grade fevers. A\nCT scan showed continuing fluid collection near your hip. A\nGirdlestone procedure was performed in which your hip hardware\nwas removed and a spacer placed. You will receive IV antibiotics\nfor the next several weeks for this. The bacteria which grew\nfrom this wound is called VRE, which is a resistent bacteria\nrequiring special antiobiotics. You were also noted to have had\nan small heart attack sometime during [**Month (only) **]. You do have a\nhistory of atrial fibrillation for which you were previously\ntaking Coumadin, but this is currently being held.\n\n1. You will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation facility\nwhere you will have hemodialysis (HD) on your regular schedule.\nYour antibiotics will also be continued.  At a follow-up\nappointment with infectious disease, it will be determined the\nexact length of antibiotic treatment.\n\n2.

Pulmonary edema has\nresolved. Pacer leads are in standard position. Right IJ\ncatheter tip is in the upper right atrium. There is no evident\npneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. Bibasilar\natelectases have improved on the left.\n\n[**2177-3-1**] TTE (Focused views): IMPRESSION: Limited transthoracic\nechocardiography. Unable to assess regional wall motion\nabnormalities due to limited study, but overall systolic\nfunction of the left ventricle is probably normal. Severe\ntricuspid regurgitation with failure of tricuspid leaflet\ncoaptation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Unable to fully assess\naortic valve.\n\nCompared with the findings of the prior report (images\nunavailable for review) of [**2173-4-12**], the tricuspid regurgitation\nis now severe. If clinically indicated, a complete transthoracic\nexamination with Doppler is recommended.\n\n[**2177-3-4**] Portable TTE: Compared with the prior study (images\nreviewed) of [**2177-3-1**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic\npressure is now higher.\n\n[**2177-3-2**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) :\n1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.\n2. Patent portal vein. Prominent hepatic veins likely due to\nvascular\ncongestion.\n3. Possible right renal fullness seen on partial views of right\nkidney. If\nindicated, this could be evaluated with renal ultrasound.\n\nRenal U/s [**2177-3-12**]: Somewhat limited study however both kidneys\nare within normal limits with good cortical thickness, no\nhydronephrosis or mass lesions identified.  The bladder is fully\ndecompressed around the Foley catheter.\n\n[**2177-3-17**] CXR: Central venous catheter and permanent pacemaker\nremain unchanged in position allowing for positional differences\nof the patient. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, accompanied by\npulmonary vascular engorgement. Previously reported multifocal\npulmonary opacities have partially cleared with residual\nopacities mostly in the perihilar regions. This likely reflects\nimproving pulmonary edema. More confluent opacity in left\nretrocardiac region has only slightly improved and is likely due\nto a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Small right\npleural effusion has decreased in size.\n\n[**2177-3-17**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular\nresponse. Intermittent pacer spikes which do not capture\nnon-specific anterior and inferior ST-T wave changes. Modest Q-T\ninterval prolongation. Compared to tracing #1 ventricular paced\nbeats are absent. Anterior ST-T wave changes are more\npronounced. Clinical correlation is suggested.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Pleasant 87 yo female presenting with\ndizziness, hypotension concerning for sepsis initially requiring\npressors in the ICU, who was then called out to the cardiology\nservice with volume overload, AFIB  and severe TR w/ RV\ndilation. Underwent DCCV but continued to be in afib and had to\nbe transferred to the CCU for respiratory distress where she was\ndiuresed and then transferred back to the cardiology floor. She\nwas discharged to [**Hospital1 **] (LTAC).\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n# Septic Shock: The pt was hypotensive on admission requiring\npressors with signs of end organ damage including acute renal\nfailure and shock liver.  Lactate was 5.3 on admission and rose\nrapidly throughout her first day in the ICU peaking at 9.  The\npt had a recent hx of UTI and there was a concern for urosepsis,\nso she was started on broad antibiotics with vancomycin and\nzosyn and receieved a 7 day course. On exam, however, she was\ncold and clamped down peripherally, more concerning for a\ncardiogenic process.  Additionally, ECG was showing only\nintermittent capture of pacemaker. Cardiology/EP was consulted,\nand her pacemaker was interrogated and adjusted to improve\ncardiac output in setting of shock and acidosis (see Atrial\nFibrillation below). Echo was then obtained, which showed severe\ntricuspid regurgitation with complete lack of coaptation of\ntricuspid leaflets.  It was thought that this was likely the\ncause of her shock, in addition to the infectious component that\nhad instigated her acute presentation (although no infectious\nsource was isolated during her hospital course). Therefore she\nwas gently diruresed with IV lasix back to her dry weight. She\ncontinued to have intermittent respiratory difficulty likely [**3-6**]\nCOPD and fluid overload, which was alleviated with nebs and IV\nlasix.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation:  On coumadin, supratherapeutic INR on\nadmission (see below). EKG initially showed intermittent pacing\nwith evidence of pacer spikes on t-waves.  Cardiology/EP consult\nwas obtained, and on pacemaker interrogation was noted to have\nelevated thresholds above programmed output of leads leading to\nintermittent capture. PPM was reprogrammed with higher output\nand higher HR to 80s with appropriate capture. HR was increased\nto improve cardiac output to more closely match physiologic\ndemand in setting of shock. She was started on dofetilide, but\nthis was discontinued due to QT prolongation.  She was then\nstarted on amiodarone and metoprolol.  In the ICU, verapamil was\nincreased to 60mg TID and metoprolol was maintained at 50mg [**Hospital1 **].\n In this setting, home lisinopril was held to give blood\npressure room. However, the pt has a hx of not tolerating Amio\nwhich was dc/ed and the pt underwent DCCV after transfer to the\nfloor. However, pt reverted back to AFIB and had to go to the\nCCU for resp distress. QT prolongation prevented dofelitide from\nbeing continued, and metoprolol was dc/ed as it was thought to\nbe worsening bronchospasm. At the time of discharge she was put\non a higher dose of verapamil (280 [**Hospital1 **]). DCCV was performed\nagain and she continued to be in afib. Flecainide was dc/ed due\nto likely underlying CAD and was switched to digoxin 0.125 every\nother day. However, dig was also dc/ed and the pt was dc/ed on\nverapamil alone with HR in 70s and 80s. The pacemaker was\nchanged from DDIR to VVI w/ a lower HR threshold of 50 bpm.\n\n# Acute renal failure:  Creatinine elevated to 1.9 on\npresentation, up from previous baseline of 0.7-0.8 one year\nprior.  Etiology thought to be ATN vs hypotension/shock. Her\ninitial course was complicated by hyperkalemia with associated\nwidening of QRS and [**Last Name (LF) 5937**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given kayexalate, insulin +\nD50, and calcium gluconate.  Creatinine peaked at 2.9 with\nminimal urine output, however renal function improved with\ncontinued fluid resuscitation and support with pressors. Towards\nthe end of her stay she had another Cr spike (1.8 from 1.1)\nwhich improved with gentle fluid resusciation. Her Cr at dc was\n1.5.\n\n# Dyspnea: Patient became acutely dyspneic after cardioversion\nfrom Afib.  She was transferred to the CCU for closer\nmonitoring.  In the CCU, she was placed on a nitro gtt and\ndiuresed with lasix boluses. Her SOB was however multifactorial\nbut primarily d/t fluid overload vs COPD vs severe thoracic\nkyphosis as she responded to both lasix and nebs. She was also\nstarted on Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus (500/50). Torsemide was\nstarted for po diuresis as she failed po lasix diuresis.\nLisinopril was restarted at 5mg. Her 02 requirement went up to\n3L but she was comfortable on RA on dc. At discharge she was\nstable on RA but patient prone to having acute episodes of\ndyspnea that were alleviated with duonebs and IV lasix 40mg (if\nthe pt appeared overloaded on exam).\n\n# Fluctuating INR: Pt presented on coumadin for Afib (INR goal\n[**3-7**]); INR 3.5 on presentation in the ED but rapidly rose to 6.2\nupon arrival in the ICU.  Peaked at 9.7.  No signs of bleeding,\nso she was not given any reveral agents.  Etiology of acute rise\npresumed to be liver dysfunction in the setting of\nhypotension/shock. However, pt has a hx of labile INR. Recieved\nVitamin K in the CCU and had hematuria which persisted a few\ndays after resolution of supratherpeutic INR. She was bridged\nback to therapeutic range with lovenox. INR managment remained\nchallenging throughout her stay. At the time of dc her INR was\n3.5 so her coumadin of 0.5 mg was held.\n\n# Hematuria: pt continued to have gross hematuria. Unrelated to\nINR levels. Was worked up in the past w/ cystoscopy showing\nbilateral diverticuli. She has been set up for follow up appt\nwith urologist for cystoscopy. Renal u/s done here was normal.\n\n# Transaminitis:  AST/ALT in the 400s on presentation, likely\ndue to acute injury from hypoperfusion (shock liver) vs.\ncongestive hepatopathy.  Alkaline phosphatase and bili remained\nwithin normal limits, supports this hypothesis.  Transaminases\nrose to the thousands prior to coming down after resolution of\nsepsis.\n\n# Anemia: Normocytic, near recent baseline of 34.3 on\npresentation.  Despite high INR, no signs of acute bleedn other\nthan known prior hematuria that continued intermittently\nthrougout her stay.  Likely [**3-6**] chronic hematuria vs low marrow\nproduction. Her retic count was normal, and SPEP was also\nnormal.\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n# Dementia: stable; contined home meds mirtazepine and aricept\n\n# GERD: continue home ranitidine\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Patient has a variety of specialist appts\nthat need to be followed up with. In case that she develops\ndyspnea and does not respond to duonebs, IV lasix 40mg should be\ngiven. Verapamil dose can be increased to 240 [**Hospital1 **] if rate\ncontrol or blood pressure managment becomes problem[**Name (NI) 115**]. Pt's\nINR on the day of DC was 3.5 so her warfarin dose of 0.5 mg was\nheld. Please restart warfarin at 1 mg after the INR is in\ntherapuetic range.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n-Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim 800-160 mg Oral Tablet TAKE 1\nTABLET TWICE A DAY FOR 10 DAYS\n-Lorazepam 0.5 mg Oral Tablet TAKE 1 TABLET AT BEDTIME\n-Mirtazapine 15 mg Oral Tablet TAKE 1 TABLET AT BEDTIME\n-Verapamil SR 12 HR 240 mg Oral Tablet Extended Release [**2-3**] po\nQAM, and 1 po Qpm\n-Albuterol Sulfate (VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/Actuation Inhalation\nHFA Aerosol Inhaler Take 1 to 2 inhalations every 4 to 6 hours\nas needed; rinse mouthpiece at least once a week\n-Donepezil (ARICEPT) 10 mg Oral Tablet Take 1 tablet daily at\nbedtime\n-Lisinopril 40 mg Oral Tablet Take 1 tablet daily\n-Flecainide 100 mg Oral Tablet [**Hospital1 **]\n-Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Oral Tablet QD WITH ONE 25 MG TABLET\n[**Hospital1 **]\n-Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Oral Tablet 1 TABLET WITH 50 MG\nTABLET [**Hospital1 **]\n-Fluticasone (FLOVENT HFA) 110 mcg/Actuation Inhalation Aerosol\nUse 1 inhalation by mouth twice daily and rinse your mouth\nthoroughly afterward\n-Furosemide 20 mg Oral Tablet TAKE ONE TABLET DAILY\n-Ranitidine HCl 75 mg Oral Tablet Take 1 tablet twice daily;\navailable over the counter\n-Warfarin 1 mg Oral Tablet Take 1.5 tablets daily or as directed\n\n-Tramadol 50 mg Oral Tablet [**2-3**] tab po qhs\n-Loperamide (IMODIUM A-D) 2 mg Oral Tablet Take 1 tablet now,\nthen 1 tablet each 4 hrsfter each unformed stool as needed;\navailable over the counter\n-? meclizine, dosage unknown\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nATRIAL FIBRILLATION\nACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE\nHYPERTENSION\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker\nor cane).\n\n\n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 900**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2882**] MD, [**MD Number(3) 2883**]\n\n\"\n48614,6821,189348,2137-05-03,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2137-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-5-3**]\n\n\nService: MEDICINE\n\nAllergies:\nNeurontin / Bactrim / Penicillins / Macrodantin\n\nAttending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]\nChief Complaint:\nnausea/vomiting/abdominal pain\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\nNasogastric tube placement\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nPt is [**Age over 90 **] yo female with lung CA (presumed), Afib, CHF, NIDDM,\nwho p/w 3 days of N/V and abd pain.

He is\ndisabled.  He lives with his sister.  [**Name (NI) **] history of alcohol,\ntobacco, or drug use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination\non admission revealed the patient's temperature was 96.8\ndegrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 70, his respiratory\nrate was 12, his blood pressure was 92/42, and his oxygen\nsaturations were 90% on 4 liters.  In general, the patient\nwas in no apparent distress.  He was plethoric.  He was alert\nand oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat\nexamination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and\nreactive to light and accommodation.  The mucous membranes\nwere moist.  There was no thrush.  There were\ntelangiectasias.  Neck examination revealed he had a\nSwan-Ganz catheter in place.  Respiratory examination\nrevealed the patient had decreased breath sounds at the right\nbase.  There were no rhonchi and no wheezes.  Cardiovascular\nexamination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first\nheart sounds and second heart sounds.  He did have a loud P2.\nThere were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was\nsoft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity examination\nrevealed he had blisters on his shins.  He had dusky legs.\nMild sclerodactyly.  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on\nadmission revealed his white blood cell count was 15.1, his\nhematocrit was 36.8, and his platelets were 273.  His\nChemistry-7 was significant for a sodium of 129 and a\ncreatinine of 2.1 (up from his baseline of 1.7).  His\narterial blood gas was 7.44/46/123.\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The\npatient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His\nhospital course by issue/system was as follows.\n\n1.  PULMONARY ARTERY HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient with\npulmonary artery hypertension causing increasing shortness of\nbreath.\n\nThe patient was admitted for Flolan titration and sildenafil\ntherapy.  The patient's Flolan initially was left at 21\nng/kg/min and sildenafil was added at 25 mg three times per\nday.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was used to monitor his\npulmonary artery pressures.  His pulmonary artery pressures\ninitially decreased by about 10% with the doses of\nsildenafil; however, over the following days there was not\nsignificant improvement in his pulmonary artery pressures\nwith this dose.\n\nOn [**2-6**], his Flolan dose was titrated up to 29\nng/kg/min; however, due to a headache, nausea, and vomiting\nhis dose had to be titrated down to 25 ng/kg/min.  On [**2-7**], it was titrated down to 23 ng/kg/min as it appeared that\nhe was having side effects, but no change in his pulmonary\nartery pressures.\n\nWith regard to the sildenafil, he began experiencing\nheadaches.  Therefore, the decision was made to continue the\nsildenafil q.8h. as needed; however, holding for headaches\nand systolic blood pressures of less than 90.\n\nIf the patient persistently has shortness of breath, they may\ndo a thoracentesis and remove some of the fluid from the\nright lung.\n\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES/CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The\npatient with an ejection fraction of 55%.  On admission, his\ndiuretics were held until his systolic blood pressure\nimproved.  The patient was placed on a low-sodium diet with a\nfluid restriction.\n\nOn [**2-6**], he restarted his Bumex and Aldactone at his\nhome doses.  He appeared to be volume overloaded on the\nevening of [**2-6**], so he was given some as-needed Lasix.\nHe was to restart his Zaroxolyn on Monday, and it will be at\na decreased dose.  It will be Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg every Monday\nand Thursday only.  They will continue to measure\nins-and-outs and daily weights on the floor.\n\n3.  RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  It appeared that the renal failure\nhad been in the setting of over diuresis as an outpatient.\nIt improved over the course of his hospital stay.  This will\ncontinue to be followed.\n\n4.  HYPONATREMIA ISSUES:  Again, the hyponatremia was likely\nsecondary to outpatient diuresis.  This improved over the\ncourse of his hospital stay.  On discharge from the Intensive\nCare Unit, his sodium was 132.\n\n5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was\nkept on a low-sodium/cardiac diet as noted above.\n\n6.  ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was\npulled prior to leaving the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nNOTE:  The rest of this dictation will be done upon discharge\nfrom the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n                          [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 4561**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 8736**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2140-2-7**]  13:04\nT:  [**2140-2-7**]  14:16\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 103540**]\n\ncc:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\"\n49484,12849,122692,2140-02-12,NA,NA,\"Discharge summary\",\"Report\",NA,NA,\"Admission Date:  [**2140-2-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2140-2-12**]\n\nDate of Birth:   [**2090-7-7**]     Sex:  M\n\nService:  [**Hospital1 139**]\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 49-year-old male with\npast medical history of scleroderma (limited systemic sclerosis -\nCREST syndrome) and NYHA Class IIIB-IV pulmonary hypertension, on\nFlolan since [**2139-5-21**], CHF thought to be secondary to\ndiastolic dysfunction versus related to pulmonary hypertension,\nwho presented on [**2140-2-4**] status post right heart catheterization\nafter reporting a several week history of increasing shortness of\nbreath and dyspnea with exertion.\n\nPatient had been stable on outpatient regimen of Flolan 75 cc per\n24 hours, Bumex, aldactone, Zaroxolyn, and IV Lasix boluses since\nlast discharged in [**2139-11-21**].  However, for the past two\nweeks, he has noted increasing dyspnea.  He had attempted to self\ntitrate his Flolan at home without relief. In response to his\nsymptoms, he underwent echocardiogram as an outpatient.\nEchocardiogram on [**2140-2-2**] demonstrated mildly dilated left\natrium, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  The\nright ventricle was moderately dilated with moderate global right\nventricular free wall hypokinesis.  There is abnormal septal\nmotion in position consistent with right ventricular pressure,\nvolume overload, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation was noted.  There was\nsevere pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There was\nalso moderate sized pericardial effusion, which was\ncircumferential, but with no signs of tamponade other than\nbrief right atrial collapse.\n\nHe was referred into the hospital by his primary pulmonologist\nfor right heart catheterization, and titration of his Flolan.\nRight heart catheterization showed a mean pulmonary capillary\nwedge pressure of 8 (earlier measurements raised possibility of\nPCW = 27, but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] reviewed tracings and felt PCW = 8 more\naccurate), mean right atrial pressure of 5, pulmonary artery\npressure of 69/12, right ventricle pressure of 68/4.\nDemonstrated normal right and left sided filling pressures.\nCardiac output was relatively preserved at 5.52 liters per\nminute.  Pulmonary vascular resistance was increased at 421.\nPulmonary artery systolic hypertension was increased compared\nwith prior catheterizations when he had been on higher Flolan\ndoses.\n\nStatus post right heart catheterization, he was transferred\nto the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring as\nwell as titration of his Flolan.  While in the Medical\nIntensive Care Unit, the Swan-Ganz catheter remained in place for\ncontinuous monitoring.  He had a trial of sildenafil 25 mg\np.o. t.i.d. which demonstrated a drop in his pulmonary artery\npressure of approximately 10%, demonstrated increased cardiac\noutput, and a slight drop in his systolic blood pressure.\nHowever, he had difficulty tolerating the sildenafil\nsecondary to severe headache.  Also while in the Medical\nIntensive Care Unit, his Flolan was titrated up to a dose of\n23 ng/kg/minute.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

Serum\nchemistries demonstrate sodium 132, potassium 4.1, chloride\n92, bicarbonate 35, BUN 23, creatinine 1.2, glucose 108,\ncalcium 9.1, phosphorus 4.4, magnesium 1.7.\n\nChest x-ray showed paracentral increase in densities, but\nbilateral effusions consistent with pulmonary edema.\n\nChest CT from [**2140-2-2**] demonstrated diffuse central lobular\nground-glass opacities with smoothly thickened septal lines.\nThere was band-like areas of probable atelectasis at the\nbases bilaterally.  There were moderate sized right pleural\neffusions, which had increased in size compared with previous\nstudies.  There was prominence of the pulmonary artery.\nThere were minimal reticular opacities at the extreme left\nbase.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\n1. Dyspnea:  Patient's dyspnea was felt to be secondary to\nworsening pulmonary hypertension.  While he was in the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit, he had his Flolan dose titrated\nup to 23 ng/kg/minute.  He also underwent a trial of\nsildenafil for nitric oxide mediated dilatory effects,\nhowever, this resulted in severe headache and patient was\nunable to tolerate sildenafil.\n\nAfter he failed his trial of sildenafil, we attempted to\ntitrate up his Flolan dose while on the floor.  However, he\ndid not tolerate the increased Flolan dose secondary to\ndizziness, headache, and nausea.  He also underwent\nesophageal balloon studies under the hypothesis that perhaps\nsome component of his dyspnea was due to chest wall\nrestriction secondary to scleroderma.  However, his\nesophageal balloon studies showed relatively normal elastic\nrecoil of the chest wall and slightly increased recoil of\nthe lung consistent with interstitial edema/effusion or perhaps\nearly inflammatory/fibrotic changes from scleroderma.\n\nIt was postulated as well that perhaps some component of the\npatient's dyspnea was secondary to his history of right\nventricular CHF.  Therefore, he was diuresed aggressively\nwhile on the floor with Lasix intravenous, Bumex, metolazone,\nspironolactone.  He continued to be followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\nof the Advanced Heart Failure Clinic, and she and her staff\nmade recommendations as to changes to the medications\ndiuretic regimen in order to increase his subjective sense of\nbreathing improvement.\n\nIt was noted also that the patient had not been using the\nrecommended ice packs while using his Flolan at home.  These\nice packs help increase the efficacy and half-life of Flolan.\nHe was educated aggressively on the need to use the ice packs\nwith his Flolan in order to enhance his breathing.  Patient\nhad been tried on Bosentan in the past.  Per the patient, he\nfelt no subjective improvement with Bosentan alone.  It is\npostulated that perhaps, Flolan and Bosentan together would\nprovide subjective improvement in his dyspnea.  He will\nlikely try this regimen as an outpatient.\n\nAdditionally, it was noted that the patient's diltiazem had\nbeen discontinued while he was in the Medical Care Intensive\nCare Unit.  It was discontinued in hopes that perhaps ACE\ninhibitor would be more appropriate in providing afterload\nreduction in light of his history of congestive heart\nfailure.  However, after discussion with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], diltiazem was reinitiated and ACE inhibitor was\nheld.  He will likely restart an ACE inhibitor as an\noutpatient.\n\nFinally, the patient underwent a repeat chest CT scan in\norder ascertain whether the ground-glass opacities\ndemonstrated on his [**2140-2-2**] CT scan were indicated of\ncongestive heart failure or whether there was a secondary\nprocess, possibly alveolitis, going on as well.  Initial read\nof the chest CT demonstrated persistent ground-glass\nopacities. Further followup will be required to determine if\nthis due to residual interstitial edema or early alveolitis.\n\n2. Right ventricular congestive heart failure:  Patient had a\nrecent echocardiogram, which demonstrated preserved ejection\nfraction.  It is unclear whether the mechanism of his CHF was\ndue to diastolic dysfunction alone or perhaps mediated by\nsevere pulmonary hypertension.  Initially, he was continued\non his outpatient regimen of Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg 3x a week,\nBumex, aldactone with Lasix added on an as needed basis for\ncontinued diuresis.\n\nHe was followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from the Advanced Heart\nFailure Clinic, who made recommendations as to the changes in\nhis regimen.  He was noted to have a right sided pleural\neffusion on his CT scan.  He therefore was evaluated by Dr.\n[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of the Interventional Pulmonary service,\nwho did a bedside ultrasound of the patient's effusion, and\nfound it to be a small subpulmonic effusion not amenable to\ntherapeutic thoracentesis.\n\nIn addition, to his aggressive diuretic regimen, he was\nmaintained on a low sodium diet with daily weights and I's\nand O's recorded.  He diuresed well during this admission\nwith a several kg weight loss.  This corresponded with a\nsubjective improvement in his breathing.  The patient was\neducated on the importance of the low sodium diet and the\nimportance of maintaining it while as an outpatient.\nAdditionally, a family member brought in his home scale for\ncalibration compared to the hospital scale.  Of note, the\npatient's home scale was 3 pounds lighter than the hospital\nscale.  His discharge instructions were to modify to account\nfor this difference.  As an outpatient, he will be maintained\non Bumex 4 mg p.o. b.i.d., spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d. as\nwell as metolazone sliding scale based on his weights.  He\nwas instructed to weigh himself daily and follow the sliding\nscale accordingly.\n\n3. Acute renal failure:  Upon admission, the patient had a\nslight bump in his creatinine most likely secondary to\nprerenal versus diuretic-induced causes.  He had no evidence\nof urinary sediment to suggest sclerodermal renal crisis.\nHis creatinine improved with fluid hydration while in the\nIntensive Care Unit.  It remained relatively stable during\ncontinued diuresis on the floor.\n\n4. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient was\nmaintained on a low sodium diet.  His electrolytes were\nfollowed serially and repleted as needed.  His potassium was\nmonitored closely in light of his history of hypokalemia, it\nwas repleted aggressively.\n\n5. Code status:  The patient is full code.\n\n6. Access:  The patient has a right internal jugular\nPermacath.\n\n7. Disposition:  Patient was discharged to home once his\ndyspnea had improved.  Of note, his weight on day of\ndischarge on hospital scale was 69.5 kg, which is within his\nbaseline range.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Afebrile.  Hemodynamically\nstable.  Dyspnea stable.  Tolerating oral intake without\nnausea or vomiting.  Ambulating independently.  Weight at\n69.5 kg.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient was discharged to home with\nservices.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.

She has a sister with\nbreast cancer.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:   History of tobacco use, rare alcohol use.\nShe lives with her cousin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature of 102.0\nF.; blood pressure ranging from 79 to 96 over 26 to 45; heart\nrate of 89; oxygen saturation 96% on four liters by nasal\ncannula.  In general, the patient is an elderly female\nsitting in bed in no apparent respiratory distress.  HEENT:\nExtraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round and\nreactive to light.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Heart is\nregular rate and rhythm.  Lung examination with slight\ncrackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.  Abdominal\nexamination is obese, soft, nontender, with some distention.\nExtremities with one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally.\nPositive for asterixis.  Alert and oriented times three and\nable to follow commands.\n\nLABORATORY:  On admission are notable for a white blood cell\ncount of 12.6 with 78% neutrophils.  Her hematocrit is 30.4\ndown from 36.1.  Her creatinine is 2.3 up from 0.9.\nUrinalysis was negative.\n\nLiver function tests within normal limits.\n\nEKG shows possible atrial arrhythmia with a rate at 70 to 80\nbeats per minute.  There is left axis deviation and a right\nbundle branch block.  There are diffuse T wave inversions in\nthe anteroseptal leads which is new.\n\nChest x-ray shows peri-hilar haziness but no definite\ninfiltrate or pulmonary vascular congestion.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient was hypotensive with a\nsystolic blood pressure in the 60s on admission that was not\nfluid responsive.  She was enrolled in a MUST protocol for\npresumed sepsis given the temperature spike to 102.0 F.;\nhowever, in the Medical Intensive Care Unit it was felt that\nthe etiology of her hypertension was most likely\nmultifactorial.  They felt that she probably had an early\npneumonia causing poor p.o. intake in the setting of\nunderlying dysphagia, causing prerenal acute renal failure\nwhich, in turn, decreased clearance of her MS-Contin.  They\nalso felt that her acute renal failure was then exacerbated\nby Lasix causing hypovolemia and hypotension in a patient who\nis preload dependent secondary to her right ventricular\ndysfunction and increased pulmonary artery pressures.\n\nThe patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and after\nthree liters of normal saline her central venous pressure was\napproximately 17 to 20 and further intravenous fluid boluses\nwere stopped.  Her SVO2 was greater than 70, however, the\npatient remained hypotensive and so she was started on low\ndose of Levophed.  The patient was taken off sepsis protocol\nsince sepsis at that time was not suspected.\n\nThe patient was started on Levofloxacin for a presumed\ncommunity acquired pneumonia.  Urinalysis was negative.\nBlood cultures were obtained but they were no growth to date.\nIn the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her O2 remained stable\nand the patient did not require any intubation.\n\nEventually, the patient was able to be taken off Levophed the\nfollowing day and her blood pressure remained stable\nthroughout the remainder of the hospitalization.  Sputum\ncultures were obtained which grew Methicillin resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus.  Chest x-ray was now showing a left\nlower lobe opacity with a persistent left pleural effusion.\nGiven these findings, the patient was started on Vancomycin,\ninitially at one gram intravenously q. day based on age.  A\ntrough of Vancomycin level was drawn prior to the third dose\nand was found to be low at 5.9.  Following curbside with\nInfectious Disease, her Vancomycin dose was increased to 1.5\nmg q. 24 hours.\n\nThe patient, according to Infectious Disease, should be\ncontinued on the Vancomycin dose for at least two weeks.\nSince her blood cultures showed no growth, there was no need\nto prolong the course of Vancomycin for greater than two\nweeks.\n\nAn echocardiogram was obtained to determine her ventricular\nfunction as well as to look for endocarditis.  It showed a\nleft atrium that was moderately dilated, a right atrium that\nwas moderately dilated, a left ventricular cavity size that\nwas borderline dilated, left ventricular ejection fraction of\ngreater than 55%, right ventricular cavity was mildly\ndilated, right ventricular systolic function was borderline\nnormal.  She had one to two plus mitral regurgitation and\nthree plus tricuspid regurgitation.  There was moderate\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension and no pericardial\neffusion.  There was no evidence for endocarditis seen on\ntransthoracic echocardiogram.\n\nThe patient was also continued on Levofloxacin which was\nstarted empirically in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for\nfevers, for possible community acquired pneumonia and will be\ntreated with a total of a two week course.\n\nUpon transfer to the Floor, the patient developed diarrhea.\nThree separate samples on three separate days were sent for\nClostridium difficile which all returned as negative.  The\ndiarrhea improved throughout the course of the\nhospitalization.  It is felt that her initial fever was\nlikely from this pneumonia and there was no other infectious\netiology found.\n\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of diastolic\ncongestive heart failure.  An echocardiogram was obtained to\ndetermine her systolic function.  Left ventricular ejection\nfraction was greater than 55% although she had a borderline\nnormal right ventricular systolic function with one to two\nplus mitral regurgitation, three plus tricuspid regurgitation\nand moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  The\npatient ruled out for myocardial infarction on admission with\nthree sets of negative enzymes.\n\nFollowing transfer to the Floor after the patient had been\nhemodynamically stable for greater than 24 hours, the patient\nwas restarted back on her home doses of Diovan for blood\npressure control.  The patient remained hemodynamically\nstable throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.  The\npatient, however, was not started on Lasix due to persistent\ndiarrhea.  The patient was asked to weigh herself at home.\nShe was told not to take Lasix for now but should she gain\nmore than two pounds, she should call her primary care\nphysician for recommendations on whether to restart Lasix.\nThe patient is scheduled for a follow-up in three days\nfollowing discharge to see her primary care physician.\n\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient has a history of emphysema and is\non home O2.  She also has obstructive sleep apnea and uses\nBiPAP at home.  The patient's O2 saturation remained stable\nthroughout the remainder of the hospitalization and she did\nnot require intubation.  She was also continued on her home\ninhalers and given nebulizers as needed.\n\n4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient was admitted with a\ncreatinine of 2.3.  Following aggressive fluid resuscitation,\nher creatinine returned to baseline and it was felt that her\nacute renal failure was likely prerenal in etiology.\n\n5.  DISPOSITION:  The patient was seen by Physical Therapy\nand they recommended home with home Physical Therapy.  The\nMedicine Team recommended pulmonary rehabilitation to the\npatient, however, the patient declined pulmonary\nrehabilitation stating that she had been discharged\npreviously to pulmonary rehabilitation and that they had not\nbeen able to do anything for her.  The patient wished to go\nhome with home services.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Hemodynamically stable, ambulating,\nO2 saturations stable on two liters of oxygen by nasal\ncannula during the day and BiPAP overnight, pain free.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient is discharged to home with\nhome services including home oxygen and home Physical\nTherapy.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Dysphagia.\n2.  Prerenal acute renal failure.\n3.  Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP 8 to 10 centimeters of\nwater.\n4.  Emphysema on home O2.\n5.  Bronchiectasis.\n6.  Pulmonary hypertension.\n7.

The patient was given a prescription for Lasix but was\nasked not to take it due to her diarrhea.  She was asked\ninstead to weigh herself daily and if she gains more than two\npounds she should call her primary care physician to\ndetermine whether she should restart Lasix.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n1.
