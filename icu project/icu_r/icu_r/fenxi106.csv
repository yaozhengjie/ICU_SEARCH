Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in [**2150**], hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia, recently admitted for evaluation of a
right ankle ulcer/cellulitis.  She was discharged to home
with Keflex on [**2-24**] with a 7 to 10 day course of antibiotic
scheduled.  She was brought in today by her daughter after
being found down in her apartment. The daughter was out of
town for the last five days, returned today and found the
patient down on the afternoon of admission.  She had seen the
patient the night before and the two had had dinner and there
were no problems at that time.  There was no loss of
consciousness.  By the patient's report, there was no chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, no head trauma.
By the daughter's report, the patient had not been taking any
of her medications for the last five days.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.3??????, blood pressure 113/68, pulse
83.
GENERAL:  Alert and oriented to person only in no acute
distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Dry mucous membranes,
bilateral surgical pupils, no jugular venous distention.
NECK:  Supple.
PULMONARY:  Bibasilar rales, no wheezes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper
sternal border with 1/6 regurgitant murmur, holosystolic
murmur at the left lower sternal border radiating to the
apex.  The PMI is nondisplaced and is a normal size.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Large 10 x 5 cm medial right malleolus ulcer
with scattered areas of necrosis and surrounding erythema.
There is no swelling.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count 10.9, hematocrit 31.5, platelets
416.  SMA-7 143, 5.7, 104, 23, 43, 1.7 and 106.  Urinalysis
showed trace ketones, small bilirubin, nitrite negative, no
leukocyte esterase, no red blood cells.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion,
but no cardiomegaly.  A head CT was negative and hip films
were also negative.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially
normotensive.  She was started on intravenous cefazolin and
developed hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the
80s.  She was then started on low dose dopamine and admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Admission electrocardiogram shows ST depressions in 1, 2, F,
V5 and V6.  T-wave inversions present diffusely.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU
with a strong concern of evolving non Q-wave myocardial
infarction.  Indeed, the patient's peak CK was 335 with an MB
of 28 and an MB index of 8.4.  The associated troponin was
16.1.  After discussion with the family, the patient was
conservatively managed and cardiac catheterization was not
pursued.

With volume resuscitation, the patient's hematocrit dropped
to 26.3.  Iron studies revealed the following:  an iron of
287, TIBC of 398, ferritin of 49 and transferrin of 306.  It
was felt that the patient had anemia of chronic disease on
the low hematocrit reflected hemodilution.  Her dose of
Niferex was increased to [**Hospital1 **] and her hematocrit remained
stable after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells.

In terms of the patient's elevated creatinine, this also
responded quickly to volume resuscitation.

The patient had recently been in house with a concern of a
right lower extremity cellulitis versus pyoderma gangrenosum.
The patient was seen by dermatology and it was felt that the
lesion was most consistent with partially treated ulcerated
cellulitis.  The patient was initially started on cefazolin
and clindamycin.  She developed diarrhea in the setting of
clindamycin therapy.  Stool toxin assays did reveal the
presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin A and the
patient's clindamycin was discontinued and she was started on
metronidazole.  On the day of discharge, the patient was
switched over from intravenous cefazolin to oral cephalexin
with no difficulties.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and it was felt
that she was unsteady on her foot and would need 24 hour
supervision.

An echocardiogram was obtained which revealed a normal
ejection fraction, normal valves and no resting wall motion
abnormalities.

On [**2153-3-12**], the patient was felt to be medically stable for
discharge.  Given the setting in which the patient was
discovered and the physical therapy evaluation, it was felt
that she would benefit from a course of short term
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Discharged to short term
rehabilitation.

Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, persistent fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- mechanical ventilation
- bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o F  with PMH of CAD s/p multiple PCIs (at least 9 DESs
placed in 8 separate PCIs since [**2118**]), paroxysmal AFib (on
warfarin), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of
pericarditis, severe RA (on prednisone 5, leflunomide,
remicaide), GERD, pulmonary fibrosis (but FVC 76% of predicted
in [**2121**] with DLCO 65% of predicted), and other issues, admitted
to OSH on [**2126-11-12**].  Initially presented with flu-like symptoms
and a subjective fever for about one week.  In the ED there, CXR
showed baseline interstitial pattern and possible right basilar
infiltrate.  She was noted to have  a'red hot' leg in the ED,
but no obvious joint effusion.  In the ED, she spiked a fever to
102.8, persisting and never falling below 100.8 during her
hospitalization.  WBC was 15.4 (no bands), ESR>120, CRP>18.
Creatinine was 1.3 on admission, down to 0.9 with fluids.  Flu
was negative and blood, urine, C. diff cultures have been
negative to date.

She was given levofloxacin and vancomycin for pulmonary and skin
coverage; antibiotics were broadened to levofloxacin,
ceftazidime and vancomycin IV and PO.  Her SBP was in the 90s in
the ED, she was volume resuscitated and SBP improved.  TTE and
OSH showed an EF of 50% without valvular lesions.  SpO2s have
been in the low to mid 90s on 3L nasal cannulae.  She has also
had bad joint pain during her hospitalization.  CT chest showed
diffuse airspace disease, bilateral reticular changes of
uncertain etiology, with the differential including infection,
edema and fibrosis.

She was seen by rheumatology at the OSH, who felt she likely ha
a flare of her RA.  Steroids were increased from prednisone 5mg
to 40mg.  Leflunomide toxicity was also raised as a possible
etiology, but level is pending and it is unclear when it will
come back.

On the night of [**11-14**], she experienced chest pain which resolved
with 3x nitroglycerin.  Troponin was elevated to 0.389, but with
no EKG changes.  EKGs showed old left bundle branch block, but
no STT wave changes.Interventricular conduction delay with a QRS
of 93 was noted on subsequent EKGs.  Her lasix was held given
recent [**Last Name (un) **], but other cardiac medications were maintained.
Anticoagulation with heparin or lovenox were thoguht to be
contraindicated  in the setting of anemia and therapeutic INR.

On arrival to the MICU, she appears ill, unable to complete full
sentences and frequently short of breath.  She was able to
corroborate the above history.  She also reports possible tick
exposure at the [**Last Name (un) 8548**] and in the garden of her home in the last
few weeks. No sick contacts or recent travel.  Reports pain in
neck and shoulders, intermittently also in her back. Reports
minimal cough, but acknowledges a runny nose.

IMAGING:

- CXR ([**2126-11-16**]): Cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be
evaluated.  It is obscured by the lung abnormalities.  Mid and
lower extensive lung opacities have markedly increased from
[**11-12**].  Differential diagnosis is broad including diffuse
multifocal pneumonia, ARDS.  This could be superimposed to a
more chronic interstitial lung abnormality.  There are small
bilateral pleural effusions.

- TTE ([**2126-11-18**]): The left atrium is normal in size. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior
wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (PDA distribution). Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2126-10-17**], the overall findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 F with extensive PMH including CAD s/p multiple PCIs, pAFib
on coumadin, pulmonary fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis,
transferred here from OSH with worsening hypoxia and persistent
fevers.

# Hypoxia: Thought to be multifactorial with contributions from
an infectious process, pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of a
supra-therapeutic INR, and volume overload. CXR showed diffuse
puffy infiltrate b/l most consistent with ARDS. BAL was negative
for all infectious agents tested, and tick-borne panel was
negative. On bronchoscopy, blood was visualized, consistent with
pulmonary hemorrhage. She was intubated for airway protection,
kept on ARDS settings, treated for HCAP with
vancomycin/ceftazidine/levofloxacin for a total of 8 days, and
was diuresed with daily goal for -1-1.5L. She was transfused one
unit of blood on [**11-17**] and two units of FFP on [**11-16**]. Her INR
was supratherapeutic on admission and warfarin was discontinued
indefinitely. Workup for vasculitis including ANCA and anti-GBM
were negative. She improved on these interventions and was
successfully extubated. Her hematocrit remained stable for the
rest of her hospitalization. Immediately following extubation it
was noted that she had some stridor, but appeared comfortable.
Upon chin-lift maneuver, the stridor disappeared, suggesting a
supra-glottic cause. For this she was started on steroids. Her
stridor resolved the following day and the steroids was
discontinued. She was transferred to the inpatient floor where
she continued to do well. Her antibiotics was continued for a
total of 8 days. She was continued on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. She
continued on diuresis with lasix as needed for volume overload.


# NSTEMI: On [**11-15**], she experienced chest pain and troponin
leak. She did not have EKG changes consistent with ischemia. She
was maintained on aspirin and plavix. She underwent an echo,
which was essentially unchanged from prior. Her troponins
trended down. Per cardiology recommendations, her aspirin was
decreased to 162mg daily and warfarin was held indefinitely.

# Fever: Reportedly she had persistent fever while in OSH.
However, she was afebrile during her stay at [**Hospital1 18**]. Differential
included infectious source such as pneumonia or cellulitis vs.
inflammatory secondary to rheumatoid arthritis. She was treated
as above for pneumonia, and her fever curve was trended.

# RLE Cellulitis: Improved with antibiotics and supportive care.
She was continued on vancomycin IV with plan to complete a 14
days course.

# HSV infection: positive culture from oral swab. BAL negative
for HSV. She was started on acyclovir with plan to complete a 7
day course. Ophthalmology consult was obtained with no sign of
HSV keratitis.

# Acute Kidney Injury: Resolved with IVF rehydration in OSH.

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Per discussion with
cardiology, the decision was made to not restart her coumadin in
the setting of pulmonary hemrrohage. She was maintained on a
beta blocker and home diltiazem for rate control.

# Anemia: Baseline Hct 27-31. Likely contributions from anemia
of chronic disease and acute hemorrhage. She was transfused for
a goal Hct>21.

#) Nutrition: poor nutrition due to painful oral ulcers and poor
denture. She was seen by speech and swallow who recommended
continuing with regular diet with ensure supplements. Her
nutrition improved as the oral ulcers improved with acyclovir.

# CHRONIC ISSUES:
-HTN: she was continued with metoprolol and home imdur and
diltiazem
-HLD: continued on niacin
-Gastritis/GERD: continued on pantoprazole
-RA: on infliximab every 6 weeks and leflunomide daily. She was

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Metabolic acidosis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47y/o F with a PMH of DM, EtOH abuse, C.
parapsilosis R knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis recently
admitted with Delirium tremens/PRES now presenting with
hypotension, hypoxia and acute renal failure in the setting of
recent C. diff colitis.
.
The patient was admitted on [**6-16**] - [**6-22**] with C parapsilosis
septic knee joint and underwent debridement and drainage and
discharged home on fluconazole.
.
She was then readmitted [**2190-7-4**] - [**2190-7-19**] with AMS in the setting
of EtOH withdrawal. Because of very high BPs in MICU (probably
due to severe DTs) and MRI findings, the diagnosis of Posterior
Reversible Leukoencephalopathy (PRES) was made. Infectious w/u
of CNS was negative with negative CSF and blood cx. Upon
aggressive BP reduction and control of EtOH withdrawal the
patient's mental status significantly improved.
.
The patient was discharged home from rehab on [**8-7**]. Pt reports
she began drinking again daily after returning home from rehab.
She was seen in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic on [**8-9**] and found to have a
BP of 90/58 and pulse of 40. Her metoprolol was decreased to
50mg Q 12 from Q 6 dosing.
.
She presented to OSH on [**8-14**] with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
X 1 day after finishing a course of vancomycin for C. diff
colitis. Reports diarrhea started on day of presentation with
[**7-7**] BM over 24 hrs. Reported emesis and inability to take po.
She was admitted to the ICU. Vancomycin was restarted and IV
flagyl started. She was found to be hypotensive with SBP 85/49
and WBC of 17.9. ABG 7.18/18/126 on RA. K 2.8. AG23. Cr 3.4. She
received IV and po bicarb. HCT decreased to 24 and she was given
2U PRBC. BP improved with volume resuscitation, did not require
pressors. She was evaluated by Nephrology and felt to have ATN.
GI performed an EGD demonstrating gastritis. She developed
respiratory distress the evening prior to transfer with ABG
7.17/30/74 on 4L. She was started on BiPAP then transitioned to
6L NC prior to transfer.
.
She in now admitted to the ICU for further management. On
arrival to the ICU, the patient is in no acute distress. Denies
any complaints. Sating well on [**1-1**] L.

Knee Oblique/AP/lat
Slightly decreased soft tissues in the right suprapatellar
region but no
significant changes in the alternating sclerotic and lucent
regions of distal femur, patella, and proximal tibia. Stable
soft tissue density posterior to the right femur.

[**2190-8-21**]
CXR
Increased opacity is seen in the left lung field mid and upper
regions.
Otherwise stable appearance to the right PICC line and other
bilateral
infiltrates noted. No blunting of the CP angles. I do not see
any definite
cavitation at this time.
.
[**2190-8-19**]
Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Focal thickening at the tip of
the right coronary cusp might have increased slightly. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small
vegetation on the mitral valve (0.3cmx0.3cm) (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) at the
coaptation point. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-7-5**], the
mild mitral regurgitation is new with a small vegetation seen on
the anterior leaflet at the coaptation point

[**8-22**] MRI knee w/ and w/o contrast:
Again seen is a moderately large knee joint effusion with
enhancement of the residual synovium and/or joint capsule.
Numerous subcentimeter susceptibility artifacts anterior to the
extensor mechanism and in the anterior joint space are unchanged
and likely related to previous surgery. Note is made of fluid
extending outside the joint capsule, extending into the
subcutaneous fat, along the lateral and posterolateral aspect of
the knee (ser 6, im 18), unchanged from the prior study.

Cortical erosion of the articulating surfaces of the tibia as
well as
enhancement of the tibial plateau is unchanged and likely due to
a combination of osteomyelitis, bone infarct, and secondary
osteoarthritis. Bone marrow edema, enhancement, and erosion
along the posterior aspect of the patella is unchanged and are
likely related to osteomyelitis, infarct, osteoarthritis, and an
abutting bone fragment. Bone marrow signal alteration and linear
areas of enhancement in the femoral condyles is unchanged and
may be related to osteomyelitis and/or bone infarcts. Again seen
is cortical irregularity and some areas of cortical disruption
along the femoral condyles.

No definite intraosseous or subcutaneous abscesses.

IMPRESSION:

1) The overall appearance is unchanged compared with [**2190-5-12**]. No
change in
bone marrow signal abnormalities in the femoral condyles, tibial
plateau,
proximal tibial metaphysis, and posterior patella, which likely
reflects some combination of osteomyelitisand/or residual edema
from treated osteomyelitis, bone infarcts, and secondary
osteoarthritis. No new areas of enhancement or bone marrow
edema.

2) Moderately large joint effusion, unchanged since [**2190-7-15**].
.
[**8-23**] Renal ultrasound:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12.6 cm. The left kidney
measures 12.3
cm. No mass, stone or hydronephrosis is demonstrated within the
kidneys.
There is a trace right pleural effusion. The bladder is
moderately distended without focal mass lesion detected within.

IMPRESSION:

1. No hydronephrosis.

2. Trace right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admited to the ICU and then transferred to the floor.

Right knee C.Parapsilosis septic arthritis/osteomyelitis -
started diflucan on [**6-16**] but noncompliant. Knee exam appears
stable, MRI generally unchanged; [**Month/Year (2) **] did not feel it
clinically warranted tapping. As renal function increased over
MICU stay, ID advised increasing diflucan dose. Now on [**6-11**]
months of PO fluconazole. To follow-up with [**Month/Year (2) 1957**] and ID as
outpatient.
.
Possibe endocarditis:  Echo showed small new vegatation on
anterior leaflet of mitral valve.  Not present on TEE from early
[**Month (only) 205**]. Discussed with cardiology and reviewed imaging together;
follow-up in approximately 3 weeks with TTE to see if change in
imaging (appointment as outpatient). No TEE necessary at this
point in time. Patient has never been bacteremic or fungemic. No
new murmur auscultated, no [**Doctor Last Name **] spots or other findings
suggestive of embolic disease seen by optho consult.
.
Acute renal failure with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and
metabolic acidosis: Hx NSAID abuse. Gap and non-gap acidosis on
admission, initially thought to be secondary to diarrhea,
however low bicarbonate persisted beyond diarrhea cessation with
associated hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hypernatremia. This
raised the question of RTA, but that is/was problem[**Name (NI) 115**] to
invoke in setting of ARF. Renal consulted. Pt treated with
bicarb and then bicarb normalized. She continued to have some
hyperchloremia, likely due to IVF which had previously been
given. Hypokalemia corrected with repletion ?????? may also be [**2-1**]
prolonged diflucan course or alcohol abuse. Renal advised
starting potassium citrate ?????? not on formulary, switched to
Bicitra; then d/c'd bicitra as renal function and acid/base
status improved. Renal advised PO potassium and magnesium daily,
and regular checks of electrolytes (chem 10) and renal function.
.
Possible UTI ?????? urine culture showed 10-100,000 klebsiella
species.  Started Ciprofloxacin, 7 day course (last day [**8-25**]).
.
Clostridium dificile colitis:  Pt started on treatment course
for C. difficile from OSH. Unclear how compliant pt has been
with treatment course, and c.diff +ve at OSH so decided to
restart a treatment course here. Initially on vanc/flagyl.
C.diff culture negative x2 here in hospital. No diarrhea since
admission. Now just PO vancomycin (last day [**8-27**]).
.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure: possibly combination of dCHF,
aspiration, reactive airway disease. CXR shows findings
consistent with volume overload; expiratory wheezes [**2-1**] COPD vs
cardiogenic. Had 02 requirement, successfully weaned with
initial autodiuresis then minimal lasix. Pt irritated by
albuterol nebs, used atrovent nebs with good effect. Aspiration
precautions. Patient weaned down to room air, SpO2 100% at
discharge and without SOB.
.
Hypertension: had been hypotensive in setting of prolonged
diarrhea, dCHF, decreased PO intake. Held antihypertensives, but
then pressures were persistently elevated. So treated with
metoprolol, clonidine, amlodipine, with dose adjustment as
needed. Lisinopril continued to be held due to ARF, during
hospitalization. If continues to be hypertensive, suggest that
next med to be added/changed would be the addition of an ACE
inhibitor, ie; lisinopril (was on 40mg daily, would start at
10mg daily and titrate up, as tolerated by creatinine). Plan to
titrate down the clonidine, over 3 days, by halving dose each
day (continuing tid though).
.
Alcohol Abuse with hx DTs/PRES:
Diazepam per CIWA protocol. Got Zyprexa in ICU to provide some
sedation with decreased benzo load and clonidine. SW consulted.
No s/s of withdrawal while on floor. Discussed alcohol cessation
with patient.
.
Diabetes mellitus, type II, poorly controlled: continued lantus
and insulin SS, with adjustments to treat hyperglycemia
throughout hospital course. continue on sliding scale, and
adjust as needed to treat blood sugars.
.
Hypernatremia: corrected with free water drinking and D5W via
IV. Etiology unclear; perhaps hyperaldosterone state - please
follow-up renin and aldosterone level tests, sent from [**Hospital1 18**] on
the patient - or renal tubular acidosis are questionable.
Encourage free water drinking/hydration.
.
Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia: unclear etiology, perhaps due to
alcohol or renal disease. Started daily PO potassium and daily
PO magnesium, with regular electrolyte checks. Again, please
follow-up on renin and aldosterone level tests on this patient,
sent out from [**Hospital1 18**] laboratory.
.
Hypocalcemia - Pt had transient hypocalcemia raising question of
hypoPTH or pseudohypoPTH, however PTH level wnl and hypocalcemia
resolved with repletion.
.

Discharge Condition:
Afebrile, diarrhea resolved, creatinine improved, knee pain at
baseline, ambulating with assistance and walker. Feels eager to
leave hospital.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea due to a
bacteria called c.difficile. Because of the dehydration due to
the diarrhea, your kidneys were injured. As we rehydrated you,
and treated your diarrhea with an antibiotic called vanocmycin,
your diarrhea went away and your kidney function improved back
to approximately your baseline. We continued you on the
antibiotics you were on for your right knee infection
(fluconazole) - the infectious disease team saw you and
recommended that you continue on that antibiotic for between
6-12 months; they will explain the specific course to you when
you go to your next appointment with them. For your knee pain,
physical therapy saw you and recommended that you go to rehab.
Your breathing was initially dificult so you were on oxygen, but
as that improved you were weaned down to room air. Your
potassium and magnesium levels were frequently found to be low,
so we started you on pills for those. Your sodium was frequently
high, so we encourage you to drink water to stay hydrated.
.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop
a fever >100.4, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
re--occurrence of diarrhea, worsening right knee pain, or other
symptoms that concern you.
.
Please continue the oral fluconazole antibiotic (to treat your
knee infection) daily until you see the infectious disease
doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 438**], and then you will still continue that
medicine for 6-12 months.
.
Please continue to avoid drinking alcohol.
.
We have changed your blood pressure medication regimen so that
now you are taking the following medications:
-clonidine
-amlodipine
-toprol XL

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY

81 year-old female with CHF, CAD, prior C. difficile infection
admitted with tachypnea and dyspnea with evidence of volume
overload on exam and on CXR. She responded to aggressive
diuresis but refused laboratories and had [**Last Name (un) **] compounded by
severe C.Diff colitis. She also continued to chronically
aspirate.

MICU COURSE [**7-19**] to [**7-21**]
Patient was transferred to the MICU from the CCU service [**7-19**]
through [**7-21**] for altered mental status and hypotension. Patient
had not had labs for several days and was found to be in acute
on chronic renal failure to Cr of 3.7, which was likely from
over agressive diuresis with torsemide. Cr improved with gentle
IV hydration from 2.6 to 1.7 whil in the MICU. Mental status
improved with improved renal function. Cdiff was managed with
oral vancomycin 250 mg QID with Flagyl 500 mg IV Q8H, and
patient was kept NPO. Surgery and ID remained involved during
this care. KUB revealed colonic ileus, but patient continued to
have [**2-14**] stools per day and abdominal exam was benign.

BY PROBLEM.

1. Diastolic Heart Failure, Severe and Acute on Chronic

  On arrival to the CCU, patient was tachypneic and very short
of breath. Her symptoms were thought to be secondary to acute on
Chronic diastolic heart failure (elevated BNP and evidence of
pulmonary edema on CXR).  ECG notable for atrial flutter,
exacerbating her heart failure symptoms.  She was briefly placed
on BiPAP, but became very agitated and removed the bipap.  She
was diuresed with lasix drip and given morphine.  Patient was
volume overloaded on exam, with . She was initially diuresed
with a lasix drip and metolazone.  Her creatine increased after
diuresis and lasix drip was briedly held.  She was subsequently
started on 100mg PO torsemide. This was complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] (see
below). She was ultimately discharged on alternating doses of 30
and 40mg of torsemide. We are tolerating a creatinine of [**2-13**],
aiming toward 1.5.

2. [**Last Name (un) **]

  Patient over diuresed in the setting of refusing lab draws.
This, in the setting of hypotension, prompted a brief MICU
transfer. It resolved with IVF. In the name of euvolemia, it was
resolved to tolerate a creatinine of [**2-13**].

3. Severe C. Diff Colitis

  Patient had recently finished long vancomycin taper.  PO vanc
was started prophylactically while she was treated for her UTI
using cipro.  Cholestyramine was held given patient's complaints
of constipation on admission. This became markedly worse. She
came under control with higher doses of PO vanc and IV flagyl.
On discharge she was kept on a taper of vanc po and later
rifaximin.

4. Aspiration
   Comfort Eating
   DNR/DNI

  Patient is known chronic aspirator. Video swallow revealed
[**Month/Day (2) **] aspiration. Speech and swallow reccommended NPO. Patient
has had PEG in past, family recognized that patient prefers to
eat for comfort and pleasure. Patient allowed to eat and drink
and made DNR/DNI with no MICU transfers. At the time of
discharge, the family was considering a do-not-hospitalize
policy.

5. Atrial flutter

  Admission ECG notable for atrial flutter.  Amiodarone was
discontinued.  She was continued on metoprolol 37.5mg tid and
subsequently switched to metoprolol succinate 100mg daily. Due
to blood pressure limitations, her dose was titrated to safety.
She was discharged on Metoprolol 25 mg TID.  Patient not
anticoagulated given significant history of GI bleed, though she
was kept on aspirin 325mg.

6. CAD

  Patient has history of 3 vessel disease s/p multivessel CABG
and MVR in [**2122**]. She denied any symptoms of chest pain.  Her ECG
was without ischemic changes.  Her cardiac markers were
elevated, in the setting of CHF and renal insufficiency.  She
was continued on aspirin, metoprolol and simvastatin.

7. UTI

 Urine notable for ecoli sensitive to cipro.  Patient was
febrile in the ED, but defervesced upon arrival.  She was
treated with cipro for her UTI and started on vanc
prophylactically given her significant history of c diff. This
failed. The patient has asymptomatic bacteriuria. She should
never be treated with Cipro. She can receive cranberry juice.
Consider intravaginal estriol for treatment of atrophic
vaginitis and therefore UTI ppx.

8. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes:

 Patient was hypoglycemic on arrival to the ICU and responded
well to 1 amp D50 with appropriate response to blood sugar.  Her
insulin regimen was initially held and restarted at a lower dose
of glargine 6U (previously on 10 U) once blood sugars stable.

9. Hypothyroid: Patient continued on her synthroid.  TSH was
checked and was within normal limits.
.
#. HTN: Metoprolol
.
#. HLD: Continued home statin.

SPECIAL NOTES
1. Please check Na, K, HCO3, Cr and BUN every 3 days. This
information is crucial to the management of her heart failure.
It is appropriate and encouraged to keep her Creatinine at 1-2
(~1.5)
2. Physical Therapy: Please work on strength and stamina. Keep
Out of bed for meals.
3.  Telemetry. Patient in atrial fibrillation. Tachycardia > 110
can be a sign of overdiuresis.
4. Diuretics:
a. Weigh patient daily. If increase in > 3lb, must contact MD
and increase diuretic
b. Must tolerate creatinine between 1 and 2. Effective diuresis
causes mild renal failure. If creatinine > 2, then reduce
torsemide dose. If cr < 1.3, then increase torsemide dose.
Consult with MD. Consider changing dose by 10 mg.
c. Patient is resistent to oral lasix
5. UTIs
a. Do not give patient antibiotics for UTI unless positive that
it is causing symptoms. Cipro causes C.Diff
b. Encourage cranberry juice consumption
c. Consider Intravaginal estriol for atrophic vaginitis and
prevention of bacteriuria
6. Aspiration
Patient chronically aspirates. Her family is aware of this. She
was allowed to eat for comfort.

Date of Birth:                Sex:  M

Service:  ORTHOPEDIC

The patient was initially on the Service of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1022**] of
Orthopedics.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] is a 50 year old
male with a past history significant for hepatitis C,
depression, childhood asthma, chronic low back pain status
post fall to the low back three months prior to admission,
anxiety, history of suicide attempt times two with last in
[**2176-7-10**], status post penile implant, and status post
left rotator cuff in [**2173**].  The patient was admitted to the
hospital under the Orthopedics Service and taken to the
Operating Room on [**2176-9-26**], where the patient underwent
uncomplicated L5-S1 decompression/fusion with right ICBG
placement for noted lumbar spondyloses.

The patient initially tolerated the procedure well without
complication.  The patient was transferred to the Floor on
[**2176-9-27**].  The patient was noted to exhibit increasing
confusion.  The patient's epidural catheter was discontinued
on postoperative day number one and the patient was started
on PCA pain control.

On [**2176-9-28**], postoperative day number two, the Orthopedics
Service notes the patient increasingly confused and now
agitated.  Psychiatry is consulted.  Conclusions of
Psychiatry consult are the following:  History and
presentation of agitation, somnolence and disorientation
consistent with delirium, although patient has denied recent
alcohol use, his past history would strongly suggest alcohol
withdrawal.  Psychiatry Service suggests alcohol withdrawal
prophylaxis with Ativan, continuation with one-to-one sitter
for patient's safety.

On [**2176-9-29**], the patient was noted to be increasingly
agitated, fever of 100.5 F., is noted; tachycardia to 110
beats per minute noted.  Orthopedics Service continuing with
alcohol withdrawal prophylaxis, Ativan and normal saline drip
for decreased sodium and chloride in the likely setting of
volume depletion.

On [**2176-9-30**], Orthopedics Service is called to see patient
for increasing tachypnea, tachycardia and general agitation.
A fever is noted at 101.3 F.; heart rate between 110s and
120s.  EKG is notable for sinus tachycardia.  A portable
chest x-ray is notable for poor inspiration.  Left lateral
lung parenchymal margin not captured; patchy asymmetric
vascular congestion, greatest in right middle lobe.  Right
upper lobe and left lower lobe with hilar fullness.  Cannot
rule out right middle lobe infiltrate with normal cardiac
silhouette.

On [**2176-9-30**], postoperative day number four, a Medical
consultation is obtained for the above symptomatology.
Recommendations are to discontinue intravenous fluid in
likely setting of volume overload, position the patient
upright, cycle CK and troponin to rule out myocardial
infarction in the setting of congestive heart failure.  Begin
Levaquin 500 intravenously q. day as treatment for likely
pneumonic process.  Recommending CT angiogram to rule out
pulmonary embolism in the setting of immobility and recent
surgery.

On [**2176-9-30**], the Medical Service accepted the patient from
the Orthopedic Service for further treatment for complicating
issues.

On [**2176-9-30**], while in the service of the Medical Team, the
patient underwent CT angio of the chest to rule out pulmonary
embolism which was noted as negative.  Mental status change
continued in the setting of delirium; alcohol withdrawal was
suspected.  Haldol for p.r.n. agitation was continued while
QTC interval was monitored.  Antibiotic regimen was changed
from Levaquin to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for possible
aspiration pneumonia coverage.

On [**2176-10-1**], postoperative day number five, medical
cross-coverage was called to see the patient for increasing
respiratory rate from 34 to 50 per minute and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, now notable to be unresponsive to sternal rub or
painful stimuli.  On physical examination, it was noted the
patient's pupils were fixed and dilated with only minimal to
sluggish responsiveness.

Chest x-ray was noted for increasing right middle lobe
infiltrate and right middle lobe opacity.  On [**2176-10-1**], in
the morning, at around 09:15, an Anesthesia Code was called.

Anesthesia Team responded to the bed of Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] and noted
unresponsiveness and agonal breathing.  The patient was
intubated successfully with the use of Atonomate 10 mg,
succinyl choline 100 mg.  A MAC 3 blade was used without
complications and an 8.0 endotracheal tube was used.  Good
breath sounds were noted bilaterally and a right femoral vein
line was inserted at that time.

On [**2176-10-1**], postoperative day number five, the patient was
transferred to the Service of the Medical Intensive Care
Unit-[**Location (un) **] Team.  Initial thoughts on accepting the patient
Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] by the Medical Intensive Care Unit Team:  From a
respiratory standpoint the patient demonstrated a large
pneumonic process on chest x-ray with [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
necessitating intubation.  The plan was for pressure support,
ventilation, and treatment with Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin,
Flagyl and aggressive pulmonary toilet.

From a neurological standpoint, differential included alcohol
withdrawal versus metabolic versus infectious, although the
patient had denied alcohol use since [**2176-2-8**].  From a
neurological standpoint, head CT scan the prior evening on
[**2176-9-30**], was noted as negative for acute process.

On [**2176-10-1**], the patient was procedurized with a right
radial arterial line and a left subclavian Cordis
PA-catheter, both without complications.  Initial readings of
PA-pressure are 25/10, wedge was 5.  The patient was noted to
have a fever of 108.0??????F.  Aggressive use of ice packs and
cooling blankets were utilized.  Surgery was consulted which,
on [**2176-10-1**], placed a right chest tube, #36 French, without
complication with infusion of one liter of cold sterile
water.

On [**2176-10-2**], the patient was noted to be hyperthermic to a
temperature maximum of 108.0 F., despite cooling blankets, OT
lavage and placement of chest tube.  Dantrolene was given,
100 mg intravenously times one for fear of malignant
hyperthermia secondary to succinyl choline versus Haldol use.
Arterial blood gas notable for severe acidosis.  Started on a
bicarbonate drip.  The patient was noted to be persistently
hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and
continuing use of Neo-Synephrine, Levophed and vasopressin
drips.

Acute renal failure was noted to be worsening on [**2176-10-2**].
The Renal Service was consulted which noted a rise in CK to
initially 13,500.  Renal dysfunction thought secondary to
hypoperfusion/rhabdomyolysis.  Urine output was noted to be
minimal.  As such, Renal Service proceeded with CVVH
treatments via left femoral Quinton placement without
complications.

On [**2176-10-3**], it was noted that the patient's CPK levels
were 49,305, consistent with a picture of rhabdomyolysis.
BUN and creatinine indicating worsening renal function.
Lactate worsening to 11.3.  The patient was started on CVA
with citrate anti-coagulation on [**2176-10-3**].  Temperature
maximum noted on [**2176-10-3**], was 102.0??????F.

On [**2176-10-3**], postoperative day number seven, in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the patient's white count was noted to
be 33.1 despite aggressive antibiotic therapy including
Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for question
of central nervous system process.

On [**2176-10-4**], at 01:15 a.m., Medical Intensive Care Unit
cross cover intern was called to see patient for lack of
respirations.  On examination, the patient did not respond to
verbal or noxious stimuli.  Pupils were fixed and dilated.
There were no peripheral pulses.  Auscultation of the chest
for two minutes revealed no breath sounds and no heart
sounds.  The patient was pronounced dead at 12:55 a.m. on
[**2176-10-4**].

Chief Complaint:
CC: shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
64 yo male with Hx of CAD s/p NSTEMI, severe COPD with multiple
intubations on chronic steroids who was recently discharged on
[**2103-8-13**] after a flare now being admitted for hypercarbic
respiratory failure and hypotension. Pt was recently
hospitalized for similar presentation on [**2103-8-4**] for which he
was intubated for 3 days and treated with an 8 day course of
Ceftazadime for pseudomonas that grew from his sputum and
Vancomycin for suspected sepsis for 3 days. He also breifly
required Norepinephrine for hypotension although all blood
cultures and Urine cultures remained negative. He now presents
from with home after waking up acutely short of breath. He
reports feeling well after discharge but was having difficulty
last night sleeping and decided to take Ambien 5mg which has
worked well for him in the past. He awoke 4 hours later with
shortness of breath. He attempted using his albuterol nebulizer
with minimal response and decided to call EMS. He denied any
cough, sputum production, fever, chills or increasing SOB
leading up to this episode. He denied any chest pain, chest
tightness or palpitations.
.
In the ED he was started on bipap with ABG of 7.35/58/265
although no initial ABG obtained. He was initially hypertensive
and tachycardix with BP of 200/100 and HR 140 but became
hypotensive after starting BIPAP mask. He was started on
Ceftazadime and vancomycin due to hx of Pseudomonas in sputum
and MRSA PNA in the past. He was also given IV solumedrol for
COPD exacerbation. His SBP was mildly improved after 1L IVF so
sepsis protocol was not initiated.
.
On transfer from [**Name (NI) 153**] pt reports that he is breathing much, much
better than on admission, feels that the majority of his
symptoms were exacerbated by the heat and humidity.  Feels that
he will be ready to go home soon, after another day or so.
Wants to get out of bed and walk more.  Pt has been off
antibiotics, and has been transitioned to PO steroids.  O2
requirement is 4L currently, which is his home level.  Pt is
very pleased with how things are going.  No F/C, no N/V, no
CP/SOB, no dysuria, no BRBPR/melena.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with good systolic
function. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypercarbic respiratory distress, although the ABG
obtained in the ED suggested that the patient had good response
to noninvasive ventilation.  There was no sign of pneumonia on
CXR, and no evidence of increased sputum production to suggest
bronchitis or bronchiectasis.  Pt was placed on Prednisone 60mg
with plans for a slow taper.  It was felt the the acute nature
of this episode's onset was concerning for CHF in the setting of
ischemia.  Even though he has no CAD on cath in [**4-10**], he does
have a hx of NSTEMI representing possible troponin leak from
diastolic dysfunction and subendocardial ischemia.  The initial
ECG on admission suggested rt heart strain but this is not
unexpected in the setting of the patient's known pulmonary
disease. Cardiac enzymes were obtained x3 and were negative.
The patient was observed overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where good O2
sats were observed on 4L by NC, along with neb treatments and
prednisone.  A TTE was obtained that showed no evidence of new
CHF.  The patient was transferred to the general medical floor,
where he remained stable and by self-report was near or at his
baseline.  The patient did note exercise intolerance [**2-7**] air
hunger, but stated that this was not proportionally different
from his USOH PTA.  The patient received a total of 3 days of
Prednisone 60mg, and was then decreased to 40mg on the day of
discharge.  The patient was given instructions for a very slow
taper that would bring him to no less than 20mg per day of
prednisone by the time Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] saw the patient later in
the month.  PCP prophylaxis was considered by the attending
given the length of the prednisone taper, but was decided
against.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] recommended BiPAP overnight, and this
was started and titrated by respiratory care to settings of
[**12-11**].  The patient tolerated this overnight without significant
problems.  The patient had been given a BiPAP machine roughly 6
months ago from his home health agency, but he had not been
using it due to what he calls 'incorrect settings'.  Eventually
they took it back from him.  In order for him to re-qualify for
reimbursement for BiPAP, Medicare requires documentation of an
ABG with a PCO2 greater than 55 (which this patient has many of)
and also documentation of the patient desaturating to < 88% on
2L or less of O2 by nasal cannula for 5 or more minutes.  The
home health company stated that this must be in the form of a
computer printout or graph.  No oximeter in the inpatient side
of [**Hospital1 18**] is capable of producing this printout.  Hence, the
patient will be discharged without BiPAP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] and
the patient will work toward getting a study that will qualify
him for home BiPAP as an outpatient.
*
2. Hypotension: The patient had episode of hypotension in the ED
in the context of non-invasive ventilation.  The hypotension in
addition to the patient's elevated WBC count on admission raised
concern for sepsis, but the patient's low lactate as well as the
rapid BP response to cessation of CPAP and starting of IV fluids
allayed this concern.  The patient was initially started on
Ceftazidime and Vancomycin amid this picture, but these
medications were quickly discontinued as the initial clinical
picture quickly improved.  His outpatient Lisinopril dose was
initially held in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but was restarted on the medical
floor prior to discharge, with no further episodes of
hypotension.
*
4. Thyroid function: a TSH was checked in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], which was
very low.  A follow-up free T4 was also checked, and was found
to be in the normal range.  It is difficult to interpret these
findings given the patient's acute COPD exacerbation and the
stresses of an ICU stay.  Hence, the patient should have his TSH
re-checked as an outpatient for further management.

Imaging/Studies:

CT head [**3-28**]:

FINDINGS: There is a small subgaleal hematoma and soft tissue
swelling
overlying the left frontal bone. There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage,
edema, mass effect, or infarct. The ventricles and sulci are
prominent,
consistent with age-related atrophy. Supratentorial and
periventricular white
matter hypodensities reflect sequelae of chronic small vessel
ischemic
disease. There is bilateral calcification of the cavernous
carotid arteries.

There is mild mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal
sinuses. The
mastoid air cells are clear. There are no fractures. The orbits
are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.

CXR: [**3-28**]

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2167-8-31**], there is continued
enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion
or pleural
effusion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

EEG [**3-29**]:

IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured two pushbutton activations
which
were described above. Routine sampling showed a mildly slow and
disorganized background consisting of mixed theta frequencies.
There
were no definite electrographic seizures seen on this recording;

however, retrospectively, one of the pushbuttons showed some
associated
subtle right central rhythmic activity.

EEG [**3-30**]:

IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling showed a mildly slow and disorganized background
consisting
mostly of mixed theta frequencies. There were no areas of
prominent
focal slowing and there were no epileptiform features seen.

EEG [**3-31**]:

IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured two pushbutton activations
for
twitching with no electrographic correlate. The background
activity
showed focal slowing in the right central and left temporal
areas
suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in these areas. There were
no
clear epileptiform features

EEG [**4-1**]:

IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
There
were a few generalized sharp waves, but these had more of a
triphasic
appearance than a spike and slow wave morphology. The background
was
mildly slow throughout, and there was modest frontal slowing, as
well.

EEG [**4-2**]:
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling and automated detection programs showed no clear
epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures. The routine sampling
showed mild
slowing of background frequencies throughout. There were no
prominent
focal findings.

CXR [**3-30**]:

A Dobbhoff tube is coiled within the esophagus. The cardiac
silhouette is
enlarged, unchanged from prior. There is no evidence of
pulmonary or
interstitial edema. The mediastinal silhouette, hilar contours
and pleural
surfaces are normal. There is a small left pleural effusion and
associated
atelectasis. The remaining lungs are well expanded and clear.

Repeat:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the
Dobbhoff
tube tip now lies within the upper stomach, just distal to the
esophagogastric junction. Little change in the appearance of the
heart and lungs.

CXR [**4-3**]:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-1**], there are lower
lung volumes,
which most likely accounts for the increased prominence of the
transverse
diameter of the heart. Basilar atelectatic changes are seen, but
no evidence
of acute focal pneumonia.

The Dobbhoff tube has been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo man with PMH of focal epilepsy, status epilepticus, Afib
on coumadin, CAD, HTN, HL, OSA admitted to the neuro ICU for
focal motor seizure with generalization.  At OSH/[**Hospital1 **] ED he
received 7mg IV Ativan, 2gm Dilantin, 1 gm Keppra, 100mg
Oxcarbazepine, 130mg PHB, his focal motor seizure abated.

NEURO:

At time of admission he still intermittently had left foot
clonus, a few seconds at a time.  He was lethargic and
inattentive.  Focal seizure exacerbation and generalization were
attributed to 1. wean of zonegran by his wife and 2. UTI.
Remaining infectious w/up was negative (CXR).

He received 1g of Keppra IV load in ICU folled by 1g [**Hospital1 **] for 1
day.  Given persistent somnolence and episodes of apnea (30-45
seconds) with bradycardia, and relatively rare L foot myoclonus,
keppra was decreased to 500mg [**Hospital1 **].  On this regimen MS improved,
he became more alert and oriented to [**Hospital1 18**] and year, however
remained sedated. He was continued on oxcarbazepine 300mg [**Hospital1 **],
increase in which in the past has caused increasing fatigue and
somnolence.  The Keppra was later tapered off, and the
oxcarbazepine was increased to 600mg [**Hospital1 **].  The occasional focal
left foot myoclonus was not found to have an EEG correlate.

CV. Initially volume overloaded, however, as PO intake decreased
and maintenance dose of diuretic was continued, he reached
euvolemia.  He is currently on Coumadin for his Afib, and given
his current diarrhea, his INR should be followed every 2-3 days
until his diarrhea has resolved.

PULM.  Multiple, frequent episodes of apnea while asleep and
sedated, at times reaching 40-45 seconds in duration with
bradycardia to 40s without desaturation.  Previously diagnosed
with OSA however unable to tolerate CPAP due to discomfort.
Patient was maintained on BiPAP while at night and improved.  It
was felt that significant contribution to fatigue and somnolence
were contributed to by hypercarbia

ID.  UTI, treated with CFTX IV x 10 days. UCx was initially
contaminated, however did have hx of frequent UTIs.  On [**4-4**] he
was noted to have rising WBC count, and diarrhea.  Repeat U/A
and CXR were negative, however given the diarrhea, stool was
sent for c diff and he was started on PO vancomycin, to be
continued through [**4-17**].  Based on discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
may benefit from standing Macrobid in the future for UTI
prevention, but will hold off on this plan for now given the
current c diff infection.

FEN: He was evaluated by speech and swallow, and approved for
regular solids, nectar thick liquids and crushed pills.  He is
able to take thin liquids between meals.

and s/p cadaveric kidney transplant after lone kidney became
dialysis dependent and stopped functioning well, who comes in
complaining of CP. He was last well 3 days PTA when lifting
heavy trash right after lunch at work when he felt acute chest
pain that was burning in nature in his sternum that radiated to
his back. It was severe in nature and was relieved with rest

does not remember how long it lasted for.

He had no pain the following day and then 1 day PTA the same
pain returned while watching TV and after eating spicy food.
This time the pain lasted for 30 minutes and was relieved by
burping and drinking gingerale and milk. The pain retuned this
morning without eating and  was again relieved by drinking milk.
The pain this morning was not as severe as times before.

Of note, he states that he does not experience any exercise
chest pain and is on his feet and walking all day without
problem. If he walks uphill he does get short of breath but
otherwise does not feel limited by his lung capacity.

Final Report
RENAL TRANSPLANT

COMPARISON: [**2105-11-2**].

HISTORY: Worsening renal function. Evaluate with Doppler.

FINDINGS: The right lower quadrant renal transplant kidney
measures 13.7 cm.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid
collections. There
is normal color flow within the transplanted kidney. The
resistive indices in
the upper, mid and lower pole of the transplant kidney measure
0.78-0.81,
0.81-0.87, and 0.77 respectively. These are slightly elevated
when compared
to most recent prior exam, which had resistive indices measuring
0.77, 0.70
and 0.70 in the upper, mid and lower pole respectively.

There is normal color flow and waveforms within the main renal
artery and
vein. The bladder is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Slightly increased resistive indices in the upper,
mid, and lower
pole as described above. No perinephric fluid collection or
hydronephrosis
identified.



The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  5.5	% MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  72

INTERPRETATION: This 61 yo IDDM man with ESRD s/p transplant '[**01**]
was
referred for evaluation of chest pain. The patient performed 5.5
minutes
of a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol(~4.2 METs) and stopped due to
progressive
shortness of breath. This represents a limited exercise
tolerance. The
patient presented with 1/5 dyspnea which he states he has all
the time.
This progressed rapidly to a [**5-10**] by peak exercise. In the
presence of
baseline non-specific ST-T wave changes, there was additional
0.5-1mm of
horizontal/slighlydownsloping ST segment depression
inferolaterally at
peak exercise. These changes became inverted/biphasic T waves in
recovery and returned to baseline by 10 min. Rhythm was sinus
with rare
isolated VPBs. Heart rate response to exercise was blunted(72%
of
predicted maximum) in the presence of beta-blockade therapy.
Baseline
systolic hypertension with an appropriate/slightly exaggerated
exaggerated response to exercise.

IMPRESSION: Limited exercise tolerance due to shortness of
breath.
Possible ischemic EKG changes(although are probably nonspecific)
in the
presence of baseline ST-T abnls. Nuclear report sent separately.

18.4 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Tetrofosmin Stress ([**2107-8-15**]);
HISTORY: 61year old male with HTN, DM, presenting with angina

SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

Exercise protocol: modified [**Doctor First Name **]
Resting heart rate: 70
Resting blood pressure: 162/68
Exercise Duration: 5.5 min
Peak heart rate: 115
Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 72%
Peak blood pressure: 200/70
Symptoms during exercise: progressive dyspnea, no chest pain
Reason exercise terminated: progressive dyspnea
ECG findings: 0.5-1 mm horizontal/downsloping inferolaterally

METHOD:

Resting perfusion images were obtained with Thallium-201. Tracer
was injected
approximately 30 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

At peak exercise, approximately three times the resting dose of
Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m
tetrofosmin was administered IV. Stress images were obtained
approximately 15
minutes following tracer injection.

Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT

INTERPRETATION:

The image quality is adequate.

Left ventricular cavity size is slightly increased.

Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the
left ventricular myocardium.

Gated images reveal normal wall motion.

The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%.

Compared with the study of [**2101-7-27**], the left ventricular size
is slightly
increased.
IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion at the level of
exercise achieved.
2. Slightly dilated left ventricular cavity size, normal left
ventricular
systolic function, LVEF=60%.

   Please evalute for posisble cause of ascites.
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   Renal Failure
Provisional Findings Impression: SBNa TUE [**2107-8-16**] 6:13 PM
Mesenteric edema, nonspecific. Causes include third spacing and
vascular
compromise. Clinical correlation is recommended. No significant
amount of
ascites. Small amount of free fluid in the perihepatic and right
paracolic
gutter.
Final Report
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST.

COMPARISON: [**2104-2-3**].

HISTORY: 51-year-old male with end-stage renal disease status
post right side
transplant with worsening renal function and possible ascites.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images through the abdomen and
pelvis were
obtained. No IV contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal
reformats
were performed.

FINDINGS: There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions. There is a
5-mm left
lung base nodule (2, 15) which is stable since [**2104**]. Within the
limitations
of a non-contrast exam, the liver, gallbladder, right adrenal
gland is
unremarkable. The patient is status post left nephrectomy and
left
adrenalectomy. The right kidney is atrophic. The pancreas is
unremarkable.
Just inferior to the pancreas within the root of the mesentery
extending from
the inferior portion of the duodenum is extensive fat stranding
and edema
within the mesentery. This is nonspecific (2, 48). Small bowel
loops are
normal in caliber and without focal wall thickening. There is no
evidence of
free air. Small amount of free fluid is identified within the
perihepatic
space (2, 18) and along the right paracolic gutter (2, 70).
Incidental note
is made of a distal esophageal duplication cyst (2, 21) which
measures
approximately 1.2 x 1.4 cm. Small bowel loops are normal in
caliber and
without focal wall thickening. There is no evidence of
pneumatosis or free
air.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Patient is status post transplanted kidney in
the right
lower quadrant. A stent is identified within the renal artery.
The appendix
is normal. The rectum, sigmoid colon, prostate is unremarkable.
Scattered
calcifications in the prostate gland are noted. A clip within
the bladder is
unchanged (2, 81). There is no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
identified.
Increased diffuse sclerosis of the osseous structures are likely
related to
renal osteodystrophy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mesenteric edema extending from the root of the mesentry just
inferior to
the pancreas adjacent to the duodenum, nonspecific in etiology.
Differential
diagnosis includes edema secondary to third spacing or vascular
compromise
(SMA/SMV thrombosis?), or possibly bowel pathology although not
abnormalities
are noted in the bowel. It is unlikely that this represents
pancreatitis as
the edema and fat stranding are inferior to the pancreatic bed.

Final Report
TRANSPLANT RENAL ULTRASOUND

CLINICAL HISTORY: Possible renal artery stenosis. Evaluate flow
velocities
and degree of stenosis.

FINDINGS: Transplant Doppler ultrasound was performed. The
transplant kidney
measures 13.2 cm, and appears similar in size when compared to
the prior
examination, without evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric
collection.
Vascular assessment, including both color and pulse wave Doppler
demonstrates
resistive indices between 0.79 and 0.82 within the parenchyma,
and 0.86 in the
main renal vein. There is no tardus-parvus morphology of the
waveforms or
delayed upstroke to suggest the presence of renal artery
stenosis of the
transplant kidney. The renal vein draining the transplant kidney
also appears
within normal limits.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2107-5-19**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Normal regional LV systolic function.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg. Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT [**Year (4 digits) **].

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No
valvular AS. The increased transaortic velocity is related to
high cardiac output. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. [**Male First Name (un) **] of the mitral chordae (normal variant). No
resting LVOT [**Male First Name (un) **]. Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Trivial MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may
be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is borderline dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate
diastolic LV dysfunction with elevated LVEDP. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-19**],
the findings are similar.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained,
the patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed
in supine on the angiography table.  After induction of
anesthesia, both groins were shaved, prepped and draped in
the usual sterile fashion.  Using ultrasound the right common
femoral artery was identified.  It was patent.  Real-time
visualization needle puncture into the right common femoral
artery was achieved with the ultrasound.  Hard copies of the
images were stored in the patient's chart for documentation
purposes.  Using a micro sheath the right common femoral
artery was accessed.  This was followed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire in
the abdominal aorta and a #5 French right tip sheath.  A
pelvic angiogram and transplant renal arteriogram were
performed.  This showed a patent transplant renal artery.
Given that the patient has repeated history of transplant
renal artery stenosis, we elected to intervene.

Using a Glidewire and an Omni flush catheter, we selected the
renal artery.  The catheter was then exchanged for a slip
cath and a spider coil wire was then placed across the stent.
Using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21892**] 6 x 20 mm balloon, we performed an in-stent
angioplasty.  No discrete stenoses was noted.  As there was
no lesion, we elected to terminate the procedure at this
point.  All catheters and wires were withdrawn and the right
common femoral arteriotomy was closed with a Perclose device.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present throughout the entire case.

ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
1. The right common iliac artery was widely patent, without
    stenosis.
2. The transplant renal artery was widely patent, without
    stenosis.  The stent was crossed with a combination of
    Omniflush catheter and Glidewire.  A 6 x 20 mm [**Location (un) 21892**]
    balloon was used to angioplasty within the stent,
    however no stenosis was noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 61 yo male with PMH for GERD/Barretts, HTN, TIIDM,
ESRD, and s/p kidney transplant, who came to the ED complaining
of CP. In the ED he had EKG done and cardiac enzymes started.
His EKG showed no difference to prior EKGs and only Troponin T
was mildly elevated at 0.05. He was admitted to the floor for
observation and to rule out MI.

#Chest pain: Cardiac problems are less likely because his
cardiac enzymes were negative and his second EKG showed no
changes. He underwent stress testing, which was notable for
marked reduction in ability to exercise due to SOB but he had
normal cardiac perfusion and an echo demonstrating LVEF of 60%.
In summary his cardiac workup showed it to be non-contributory
to this process. and second EKG ruled out MI and NSTEMI. His CP
symptoms and history of GERD and Baretts makes relfux the likley
cause of his pain, which brought him to the ED.

#Renal disease:Patient was noted to have elevated creatinine
from baseline elevation (2.5-3.5). Also has history of ESRD in
his cadaveric transplant kidney. His FENA on admission was <1%
which is suggestive of prerenal azotemia. He did not report
being very dry and had this high creatinine in the setting of
high BPs so he was considered also for renal artery stenosis (he
is s/p stenting in transplant kidney renal artery). The team was
also worried about chronic kidney rejection and/or glomerular
nephropathy from diabetes and longstanding HTN. Labs showed
proetinuria of 30, but his baseline is up near 300. Renal
service followed his admission closely and was advising on BP
meds, fluids, and imaging of renal artery. On imaging he had a
renal artery US which showed increased resitance throughout the
transplant but no color flow changes in the renal artery. He
continued to produce adequate urine despite his Lasix being
held. Also, a vascular surgery consult was ordered to assess for
re-stenosis. He was taken to the OR for renal artery angiongram
and possible intervention on 3 different occasions. On the first
two no intervention could be taken as he was unable to lay flat
on the operating table. He was started on lasix and his
orthopnea improved. On [**8-23**] he was taken to the OR for the third
time and was intubated for the procedure. Angiogram revealed
patency of the renal artery, despite this the vessel was
angioplastied. He developed mild respiratory failure after
extubation, had to be put on NIPPV and was transfered to the
MICU. In the MICU he was continued on diuretics and was
successfully weaned off NIPPV. He was transfered to the floor on
[**8-25**] where he was continued on diuretics and his RF improved.

#Orthopnea/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/OSA: Patient reported
multiple epsiodes of SOB, once while lying flat. Patient reports
a history of SOB with exertion from childhood (he has asthma
history but no attacks as adult). Of note is he has significant
central obesity that seems to be contributing to this orthopnea.
He also commented on abdominal distension and so CT scan was
ordered to assess for ascites, which would also be a mechanism
for pressure on the diaphragm. It showed mesenteric edema but no
ascitic fluid. His lungs have remained clear on physical exam.
He had an ABG whihc showed chronic respiratory acidosis. He also
had liver panel done to assess for hepatitis reasons for
possible ascites, which showed adequate liver function. His
orthopnea was thought to be due to a combination of dCHF, ARF
and OSA. Once patient was diuresed his orthopnea improved. He
developed mild hypercarbic respiratory failure after extubation
during renal artery angiogram, had to be put on NIPPV and was
transfered to the MICU. In the MICU he was continued on
diuretics and was successfully weaned off non-invasive
ventilation. He was transfered to the floor on [**8-25**] where he was
continued on diuretics and had no more respiratory problems off
O2. The option of nightly use of NIPPV was discussed with the
patient for treatment of OSA but he refused.

#HTN: His HTN was very hard to control while in the hospital,
his medications had to be adjusted on several occasions because
of SBP up to 200s. While in the MICU he was treated with a
labetalol drip that effectively decreased his BP. On transfer he
was transitioned to PO labetalol. His HTN was under better
control on the new regimen.

#TIIDM: His blood sugars fluctuated each day throughout his
stay. He was started on his home dose of NPH but this did not
manage his sugars well and so we switched to 20units AM and 10
units PM and a sliding scale. It is unclear why his home doses
were not effectively managing his sugars. He reported that he
eats differently at home, which could be partially contributing.
He had no more issues with hyper or hypoglycemia after his NPH
adjustment.

#CHF: His last echo showed compensated diastolic heart failure
and the echo during this hospitalization showed LVEF of 60%
demonstrating adequate compensation. In light of these results
and phsyical exam his CHF was thought to not be contributing to
his chest pain. He did have a slight troponin leak on admission
but this was thought to be due to RF.

#Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism: Patient was found to have a
persistently high Ca and a high PTH at 355. This was thought to
be due to tertiary hyperparathyroidism caused by his CRF. He was
started on cinacalcet to treat this condition.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in th [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency department for chest pain.
You were admitted and had labwork done to make sure you did not
have a heart attack or some other cardiac reason for your chest
pain. During this workup you had a cardiac stress test that
showed normal heart function and ability. You also had labwork
and tests done to make sure that your chest pain was not caused
by your heart. Your chest pain was most likely caused by your
reflux disease. You did not have any further episodes of pain
during this hospitalization. While in the hospital your kidney
transplant was also being followed because of some elevations in
your labwork. The kidney doctors followed your health throughout
this stay to see if it was still functioning appropriately. You
underwent a test to check the blood supply to your kidney which
did not show a reason for your renal failure.  You were
intubated for this procedure and you required a 2 day ICU stay
after extubation.  Your renal failure was improving by the time
you were discharged.

Please follow up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**], next week, and your
nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as below.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2114-6-6**] and underwent a laparoscopic assisted converted to
open sigmoid colectomy. There were dense adhesions to the left
sidewall that prompted the conversion from the laparoscopic
approach. After the anastamosis was performed, a small amount of
bleeding was noted in the LUQ. With further investigation, this
appeared to be related to a small capsular tear from adhesions at
the splenic flexure. Despite conservative measures, there was
continued bleeding and therefore the decision was made to perform
a splenectomy.  The patient went to the Intensive Care
Unit postoperatively.  The patient was maintained on Vancomycin
and Flagyl for perioperative antibiotic coverage.

On postoperative day 1, the patient was weaned to extubate.
On postoperative day 2, the patient continued to remain
stable in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was out of
bed ambulating on postoperative day 2.  On postoperative day
3, the patient began passing flatus and started on sips.  On
postoperative day 4, the patient was transferred to the floor
in good condition.  On postoperative day 5, the patient was
advanced to full clears.  The patient's central line was
removed.  The patient's Foley catheter was removed at midnight on
postoperative day 5.  On postoperative day 6, the patient's
JP bulb was removed from the pelvis.  The patient's diet was
advanced to regular diet and the patient tolerated this well.
She was noted to have a wound infection and her wound was
opened and she was started on dressing changes. On postoperative
day 7, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in
good condition.

IMAGING:

[**7-4**] RUQ Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: 1. Diffusely echogenic liver is most consistent with
fatty deposition although more advanced liver disease such as
cirrhosis and/or fibrosis cannot be excluded. 2. No evidence of
acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old male with hx of DM2, CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy
with LVEF 30-35% p/w diaphoresis, acute onset of nausea and
lightheadedness and was found to have UTI, [**Last Name (un) **], and hypotension
which responded to fluids in the MICU. Patient has been
hemodynamically stable since.

# UTI: Will complete a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin 500mg Q12H
for complicated UTI (male). Dysuria improved.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Resolved with IVF. Etiology prerenal azotemia, in the
context of exertion and glucosuria. Creatinine trended back to
baseline by time of discharge.

# Transaminitis: Fatty liver on RUQ ultrasound, however
cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be ruled out. Hepatitis serologies
negative. Recommended outpatient liver followup.

# CAD w/Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: LVEF 30-35%. Troponin negative
x 2. No chest pain. Continued aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril,
atorvastatin and isosorbide mononitrate SR. Held HCTZ, can
discuss restarting with PCP.

# IDDM: Continued home lantus 25 units qAM in addition to
supplemental HISS once patient started eating. Metformin held
while in-house.

# History of Afib: Metoprolol switched from home metoprolol
succinate to metoprolol tartrate for closer BP control while
in-house; switched back to metoprolol succinate on discharge.
Coumadin was held in the context of supratherapeutic INR (3.6).

# Supratherapeutic INR: Possibly secondary to liver injury.
Coumadin was held & INR monitored closely.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2128-4-22**]
PROCEDURE:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting x3, with left internal
    mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
    artery, reversed saphenous vein single graft from the
    aorta to the posterior left ventricular coronary artery,
    and reversed saphenous vein single graft from the aorta

3. Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting


History of Present Illness:
49 year-old female with type I
diabetes complicated by ESRD s/p renal transplant x 2 with
chronic rejection, s/p pancreatic transplant x 2, CAD s/p
mulitple PCIs, severe MR complicated by severe heart failure
admitted directly from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] clinic due to [**Name (NI) 9140**] heart
failure. Over the past two months she has had significant
decline
in her cardiac function. She previously been asymptomatic, but
has progressed to NYHA class III with symptoms of lower
extremity
edema, orthopnea, and dyspnea on exertion. Of note she had a
stress test in [**2127-2-7**] which showed an inferior reversible
defect. Serial TTE's have revealed [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] mitral
regurgitation
(thought to be ischemic in nature). She was last hospitalized
from [**3-27**] to [**4-4**] for a [**Month/Year (2) 1902**] exacerbation. At that time the
[**Month/Year (2) 9140**] MR was noted, however cardiac catheterization was not
completed as there was concern that the dye load from a cath
would cause her to become dialysis dependent. She is actively
considering a third renal transplant. Due to her [**Month/Year (2) 9140**] heart
failure symptoms she is being electively admitted for cardiac
catheterization tomorrow. She will require precath hydration and
renal consult due to the risk of further decline of her renal
function from contrast and possible need for HD during this
admission. Depending on the catheterization results, she may
also
need to undergo surgical evaluation for mitral valve
replacement.

Intra-op TEE [**2128-4-22**]
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinetic/aneurysmal basal inferior and basal
inferoseptal walls. The mid and apical inferior, inferoseptal
walls are severe. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35% %).

The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis.

There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There is a
ridge of calcium/tissue in the ST junction, with a small mobile
atheroma. This point seems to be cause of increased transaortic
velocity of 1.7 m/sec, The velocity at the aortic valve seems
normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral central regurgitation is seen. There is no
prolapse or flail mitral leaflets. The vena contract measures
upto 6mm.

There is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Known lastname 25457**] before surgical incision.

POST-BYPASS:
Patient is on milrinone 0.25 mcg/kg/min and levophed 0.1
mcg/kg/min.
Mild global RV systolic function.
There is a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position with
gradients consistent with the prosthesis and usual washing jets.
Mild TR.
The thoracic aorta is intact.
Overall LVEF 35%.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2128-4-22**] where
the patient underwent Mitral Valve Replacement and CABG x 3 with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well
and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Transplant
medicine followed for her history of pancreatic and renal
transplants.  Labs were monitored closely.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
remained in ICU for additional renal monitoring.  Coumadin was
started for mechanical valve.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 6, the patient was ambulating, yet deconditioned, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to Apple Rehab in [**Location (un) 25461**],
[**State 2748**] in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
cardiac catheterization with stent placement
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27045**] is a 55F with CAD s/p NSTEMI, poorly controlled CHF
with recurrent exacerbation, and DM1 on insulin pump c/b ESRD
s/p renal transplant who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **]
where she arrived in acute respiratory distress after nebulizers
in CHF exacerbation asking to be intubated. Per notes, she had
symptoms worsening for the past day of shortness of breath and
was satting 89% on 6L NRB, with SBP of 180.  She was intubated,
started on a nitro gtt, and was not diuresed prior to transfer.
Her husband states that her shortness of breath starts suddenly
and she told him he needed to call 911.  This has happened a
number of times over the past week and each time, the onset is
sudden.

She underwent an DCD kidney transplant in [**2154-12-27**].  She has
had a couple of recent admissions into [**Hospital6 204**]
with shortness of breath and volume overload. She was just
discharged yesterday from [**Hospital3 **] after 2 other recent
admission for respiratory distress; she had been intubated,
diuresed and then extubated.  She stated that she still felt
short of breath and does not feel back to normal. She is
concerned about this worsening in her overall condition. She
began her switch back from Prograf to rapamycin while she was in
the hospital (currently on both)

She recently saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the clinic [**12-22**].  In the
setting of repeated episodes of volume overload, worsening
hypertension and increase in creatinine, the concern for the
possibility of transplant renal artery stenosis vs.
Prograf-induced hypertension (hence the transition to rapamycin)
has been raised.  Transplant renal ultrasound was planned to be
completed in the [**Hospital **] Clinic, but no report is available.

In the ED, she was intubated on transfer from [**Hospital3 **].
Nitro gtt was continued for persistent hypertension and she was
given ASA PR.  Initial FSBG was 208 at 6am. Fentanyl and
midazolam were used for sedation and she was transferred to the
MICU with vitals of P 88 BP 152/44, and O2 sat of 97% on AC
400/20/8/80%.

On arrival to the MICU, she is sedated but arousable to voice
and follows commands.  She reports that her breathing is now
easier with the ET tube in place.

Imaging:
[**2156-12-25**]: Color doppler ultrasound images of the kidneys were
obtained.
COMPARISON: Renal ultrasound from [**2155-12-18**] (renal
transplant).
FINDINGS: The patient is status post right pelvis renal
transplant, which measures 12.6 cm. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collections. The resistive
indices of the main renal artery, upper, mid and lower pole
intrarenal arteries range between 0.68 and 0.83, so borderline
to slightly increased, which may reflect a parenchymal
abnormality. The main renal artery waveforms in the renal pelvis
itself show slowed upstrokes although they generally appear
fairly brisk among interlobar arteries. The renal vein is
patent. The urinary bladder is normal.
IMPRESSION: Delayed upstrokes measured among some renal artery
branches
suggesting there may be renal artery stenosis upstream
.
ECHO ([**12-27**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Color-flow imaging of the
interatrial septum raises the suspicion of a small atrial septal
defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this
study. The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is regional
hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior left ventricular
walls. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest
or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suspicion of possible small atrial septal defect.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hypokinesis of
basal and mid inferior segments. Mildly dilated aortic arch.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery
systolic pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-6-11**],
the basal and mid inferior segments of the left ventricle are
now hypokinetic; the previous images were suboptimal and
regional wall motion was not assessed. Mild dilitation of the
aortic arch is now seen; not previously assessed. There is the
suggestion of a possible small atrial septal defect on the
current study; the interatrial septum was previously intact by
2D color Doppler and saline contrast with maneuvers. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure was not able to be determined
on the current study, but was previously moderate in severity.
.
CXR ([**12-28**]):
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient
in upright
position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
next preceding portable chest examination of [**2156-12-27**].
Heart size is unchanged.  Previously described moderate
pulmonary congestive pattern with some upper zone
re-distribution has normalized. Presently no evidence of
pulmonary interstitial alveolar edema and the lateral as well as
posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.
No pneumothorax in the apical area. No acute infiltrates.
Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  A previously
described old calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe area is
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates.
.
CT Chest ([**12-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of interstitial pulmonary disease.
2. Right middle lobe bronchial obstruction with atelectasis.
Bronchoscopy is recommended for further evaluation. Prominent
right hilar lymph node measuring 7 mm in short axis diameter.
3. Multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally as described above.
Follow up chest CT is recommended in 6 months.
4. Mildly prominent main pulmonary artery could suggest mild
pulmonary artery hypertension.
.
Cardiac cath ([**1-6**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrates three vessel disease. The circumflex contains a 90%
lesion in the mid-vessel. The right coronary artery contains a
90% lesion in a small postero lateral branch. The left anterior
descending contains a 60% long lesion in the mid vessel.
2. Hemodynamics demonstrate normal biventricular filling
pressures with a high cardiac output calculated using an assumed
oxygen consumption.
3. Successful PCI to the LCx lesion with 2.5x15mm Promus DES.
4. Manual sheath removal from right CFA.
5. No complications.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI to the LCx lesion with Promus DES.
3. Patient is to remain on Aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel
for at least 1 year, uninterrupted.
4. No complications.
.
LE ultrasound ([**1-7**]):
CLINICAL INDICATION: Patient hypoxic with pulmonary edema to
assess for DVT. All of the deep veins in the right and left
lower extremity show normal and full compressibility from the
groin to below the popliteal bifurcation. Color flow and pulse
Doppler waveform analysis is normal throughout.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
.
CXR ([**1-13**]):
FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, accompanied by
pulmonary vascular congestion. Interstitial edema has improved
in the interval. Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated,
with improvement on the left. Bilateral small pleural effusions
are also evident as well as multiple
calcified granulomas in the left lung.
.
CXR ([**1-17**]):
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung
volumes have
increased. The right internal jugular vein introduction sheath
has been
removed. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has completely
resolved. On the left, however, the pre-existing pleural
effusion persists and has
minimally increased in extent. There are subsequent areas of
retrocardiac and basal atelectasis. Borderline size of the
cardiac silhouette. Two calcified lung nodules in the left apex.

.
ECHO ([**1-24**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
basal 2/3rds of the inferior wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 55-60 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index is high
(>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hyperrrophy with
normal cavitry size and regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD
(PDA distribution). Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely
due to papillary muscle dysfunction. Pulmonary artery
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-12-27**],
pulmonary artery hypertension is now quantified. Left
ventricular wall motion and severity of mitral regurgitation are
similar.
.
CXR [**2157-1-23**]

ET tube has been removed. Mild pulmonary edema has decreased.
Severe left
lower lobe consolidation is probably atelectasis, but following
removal of
left pleural tube, there could be a component of
small-to-moderate left
pleural effusion that has developed. There is no pneumothorax.
Severe
cardiomegaly is longstanding. Right internal jugular line ends
in the right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 5 cm to move
it into the low SVC.

[**1-27**] CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed
in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated
[**2157-1-26**]. A right-sided PICC line is again identified.
It is now seen to terminate overlying the right-sided
mediastinal structures at the level of the carina. Thus, it has
been withdrawn by approximately 4 cm in comparison with the
preceding examination and is now in good position in the mid
portion of the SVC provided good venous flow has been
established. No pneumothorax or any other placement-related
complications identified. Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
congestive pattern with some pleural densities in left base as
before.
.
[**2-2**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-28**], there is continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Pulmonary vascularity is
mildly engorged but less prominent than on the previous study.
Opacification at the bases with obscuration of the
hemidiaphragms is consistent with bilateral layering effusions,
more prominent on the left, with underlying compressive
atelectasis. Central catheter tip again extends to the upper to
mid portion of the SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 27045**] is a 55 y/o woman with hx ESRD from T1DM
s/p renal transplant in [**2154**], CAD s/p multiple MIs and DES to
circumflex artery ([**12/2156**]), ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF =
55-60 %) who had a very long hospital course notable for
recurrent respiratory distress, which was multifactorial
.
# Respiratory distress:  She had multiple episodes of flash
pulmonary edema in the setting of acute on chronic diastolic and
systolic heart failure.   This required multiple intubations and
transfers to the ICU. The precipitants for these events included
volume overload, transfusions of blood products, hypertensive
emergency, and coronary disease.  It was also felt that
rapamycin toxicity may have been playing a role, so she was
changed to tacrolimus.  It was also felt that nitrates may have
been causing VQ mismatch and worsening her hypoxia, so nitrates
should be avoided in the future. A Bronchoscopy on [**2157-1-5**] did
not reveal any pathology.  Her hypertension was aggressively
treated.  She was aggressively diuresed.  She was treated with
albuterol, inhaled steroids, bronchodilators, anti-cholinergics,
and a glucocorticoid taper.  She was ultimately discharged to
rehab with need for aggressive pulmonary rehabilitation.  Her
persistent hypoxia that had been present for much of her
admission, despite appearing euvolemic, improved prior to
discharge, after rapamycin was changed to tacrolimus.  Rapamycin
can cause an asthmatic type lung disease, and the patient did
have evidence of wheezing and bronchiectasis on CT scan.
.
# Subglottic stenosis: The patient was a difficult intubation,
secondary to subglottic stenosis.
.
# Pleural effusion: It was felt this effusion was most likely
related to heart failure.  Due to the risks of the procedure,
thoracentesis was deferred.  She has follow-up with pulmonary,
and the need for thoracentesis can be re-addressed at that time.
 Anti-coagulation for atrial fibrillation was deferred given the
potential need for a procedure.
.
# CAD:  She has had multiple myocardial infarctions.  Ms [**Known lastname 27045**]
had a cardiac cath on [**2157-1-5**] showing diffuse disease.  She had
a DES placed in the left circumflex.  It was hypothesized that
intermittent occlusion of this vessel (which supplies the mitral
valve) contributed to flash pulmonary edema by causing mitral
regurgitation.  Her hypertension was treated aggressively, she
was maintained on atorvastatin, and she was instructed to take
aspirin 81mg and plavix daily.
.
# Renal disease:  The patient has a h/o renal transplant in [**2154**]
for ESRD secondary to HTN and T1DM.  She was maintained on
azathioprine with dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**] (sulfa allergy).
She was transitioned to tacrolimus from rapamycin after it was
suspected that rapamycin toxicity was worsening her lung
function.  Her creatinine fluctuated widely this admission in
the setting of ongoing diuresis, medications (ACE-I / [**Last Name (un) **]), and
contrast.  Angiography did not show renal artery stenosis. She
had an acute rise in creatinine with lisinopril treatment.
.
# Anemia:  An extensive work-up was largely unrevealing.  She
did have persistent epistaxis while intubated in the ICU, as
well as persistent hemoptysis after a traumatic intubation.  She
was conservatively transfused, given that she was very sensitive
to fluid.  Additional lasix was absolutely necessary to prevent
flash pulmonary edema with blood products. Darbopoetin should be
considered as outpatient.
.
# Fevers: Ms [**Known lastname 27045**] developed fevers while in the hospital.
She had urine cultures positive for Pseudomonas, which was a
likely source.  However, she also had a pleural effusion, and
she was treated empirically for pneumonia with meropenem and
vancomycin.  She was afebrile for many days off antibiotics
prior to discharge.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: 2 episodes (once in MICU, once on floor)
with RVR which responded to 10mg IV metoprolol and 30mg IV
diltiazem.  It was felt this was secondary to cardiomyopathy and
pulmonary disease. She was initiated on warfarin (CHADS of 5).
She became supratherapeutic, and after administration of FFP
(for planned thoracentesis) she had an episode of flash
pulmonary edema.  Re-initiation of warfarin was deferred to her
primary outpatient providers given her anemia and sensitivity to
blood transfusions (volume overload) and potential need for
thoracentesis at a pulmonary follow-up appointment.
.
# Type 1 DM:  On insulin pump.  Had multiple changes to her
regimen in setting of intubation, treatment with
glucocorticoids.  Managed by [**Last Name (un) **] in-house.
.
# Iatrogenic complications:  The patient had multiple
complications from this hospitalization, including a fingerstick
of 9 while on insulin gtt in the ICU; multiple intubations
in-house, with mis-communication about her subglottic stenosis;
inadvertant placement of a venous catheter into the sub-clavian
artery requiring removal in the OR; multiple hand-offs of her
care between services, with associated poor communication
between primary teams and multiple consultanting services; and
she was discharged from the hospital with a PICC line that was
being used only for lab draws without communication of this to
the rehab center until after discharge.  The patient was
informed of these complications, and while frustrated, she was
overall grateful regarding her care, and was excited about
discharge and was planning to follow-up at her multiple [**Hospital1 18**]
appointments.
.
======
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES BY SYSTEM:
-Cardiology: Severe 3 vessel CAD, s/p DES to L circumflex. On
ASA 81, Plavix, Atorvastatin.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
with CHADs score of 5.  Not on warfarin at the time of discharge
due to potential need for thoracentesis at a follow-up pulmonary
appointment. To follow-up with Cardiology.
.
-Pulmonary: Multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema. Possible
rapamycin toxicity.  Persistent hypoxia.  Pleural effusions.  On
multiple inhaled therapies.  To follow-up with Pulmonary.
.
-Intubation: Has subglottic stenosis.
.
-Lines: was discharged with PICC line - several hours after
discharge the rehab facility was called, and informed of her
line.
.
-Renal: S/p transplant. On torsemide diuresis. On losartan. On
tacrolimus and azathioprine (dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]). AVOID
rapamycin - may have contributed to lung disease.  To follow-up
with Renal Transplant, with labs to be drawn at rehab on the day
after discharge.
.
-Endocrine: T1DM on insulin pump.
.
-Hematology:  Consider darbopoetin as outpatient for anemia.
.
-Vascular: Has PVD and an abdominal bruit was noted during the
course of her admission, which will need close follow-up as
outpatient.
.
-ID: Completed course of meropenem/vancomycin for pseudomonas
UTI and empiric pnemonia
.
-Important notes: Avoid nitrates; avoid rapamycin; For
transfusions, consider IV lasix if the volume is not needed;
Consider starting coumadin after pulmonary appointment, as this
was not started in house given the potential need for
thoracentesis at outpatient follow-up appointment.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath.  You
had an extended stay in the hospital that included several
episodes of shortness of breath, high blood pressure, and kidney
damage.  Your shortness of breath was determined to be from
heart failure, volume overload, and pulmonary hypertension (high
pressure in the blood vessels that supply your heart).  You were
treated with diuresis (water pills).  Cardiac catheterization (a
procedure to visualize the arteries that supply your heart with
blood) was performed and a stent placed in one of your coronary
arteries to help keep it open.  Bronchoscopy was performed to
look at your airways; this test was normal.  You were also
treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. You were seen by our
pulmonary (lung) doctors, who recommended a course of steroids
and nebulizers (breathing treatments). It is also possible that
one of your medications (rapamycin) was causing damage to your
lungs, so we changed this medication to a different medicine
called tacrolimus.
.
You also have a condition called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
(an occasional abnormal heart rhythm).  This puts you at a risk
of having a stroke.  To prevent strokes, patients are often
started on Coumadin (a blood thinner).  You should speak with
your outpatient doctors about starting this medication.  We are
not starting it in the hospital until you see the lung doctors
in follow-up, in case they decide to do a procedure called a
thoracentesis (to drain some fluid in part of your lung).
.
You have follow-up with the lung doctors, heart doctors, and
kidney doctors.

****Please note that we have made MANY changes to your
medications during this hospitalization.  Listed below are the
medications you should take at discharge.  We have also listed
the reason for taking them.  It is very important that you STOP
TAKING ALL OTHER MEDICATIONS unless directly instructed by your
doctors.
.
Please START:
Atorvastatin 40 mg PO/NG DAILY to lower cholesterol and protect
your heart
Azathioprine 50 mg PO/NG DAILY to prevent rejection of your
kidney

from being blocked by a clot.
Amlodipine 10 mg PO/NG DAILY to lower your blood pressure
Albuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB IH for shortness of breath,
wheezing
Bisacodyl 10 mg PO DAILY for constipation

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old white male
who was last seen in his usual state of health.  At
approximately 7 a.m. on the morning of admission, after which
time, he was found at 2:30 p.m. by his grandson to be on the
floor confused and acting inappropriately.  The patient was
taken to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of
15 initially, but decreased to 14, and he was then intubated
and sedated with need to protect the airway.  Soon after
this, he developed a seizure and wasgiven  vecuronium before
transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital.  He also
received Vitamin K and two units of fresh frozen plasma at
the outside hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Multiple cerebral vascular accidents.
He is status post myocardial infarction.  He has a positive
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a
positive history of alcohol use and two pack a day tobacco
abuse.

ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy history reaction to penicillin
and Benadryl and his current medications include Coumadin,
aspirin, metoprolol and Combivent.

At the time of admission and examination, he was intubated,
sedated and paralyzed and the examiner was therefore unable
to elicit a full neurological exam.

CT scan from the outside hospital showed a large cerebellar
hemorrhage with hydrocephalus.

LABORATORIES:  His hematocrit was 40.6, white blood cell
count 8.4, platelet count 164,000.  His PT was 16, PTT 39,
INR was 1.8 and this was after four units of fresh frozen
plasma.  The INR had come down from an INR of 4.9 initially
at the outside hospital.  His sodium was 133, potassium 4.7,
chloride 95, co2 26, BUN 8, creatinine 0.8 and blood glucose
130.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the clinical findings, the patient
was admitted urgently to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care
Unit.  A ventricular drain was placed and the patient was
placed supine with head of bed slightly elevated and the
ventricular drain allowing from drainage of cerebrospinal
fluid.  Patient was subsequently stabilized and was initially
extubated and doing well, however, later on the [**6-4**],
he was reintubated for emesis and question of aspiration.  On
the [**6-5**], he was noted to be awake and moving all
extremities but not clearly following commands.  The
ventricular drain was patent at approximately 10 cm above the
tragus and he was otherwise considered stable.

On the 10th, he remained arousable, moving all four
extremities and obeying commands, and on the 11th, he
remained intubated and when propofol was turned off for
neurological exam, the patient attempted to open his eyes to
sternal rub. His legs bilaterally withdrew briskly to painful
stimuli.  His left arm localized and he could stick out his
tongue and wiggle his toes partially to command but was
requiring careful blood pressure monitoring and control, as
well as continued sedation and continued intubation.  On the
12th, it was noted that the patient remained intubated,
sedated, but was no longer responding to call or command.  CT
scan was obtained and following this, a number of lengthy
discussions were entered with the family and with a social
worker present and decisions were made by the family to
withdraw care with consideration that they felt the family
member would not care to have his life sustained with all of
the necessary medical interventions that were being taken and
with the poor prognosis.  For that reason, and with the
family's consent and request, the patient was subsequently
extubated and converted to comfort measures only and care was
essentially withdrawn other than for comfort measures and the
patient subsequently died late on the [**2110-4-8**] with
the patient's family present and comfortable with this event.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

bicarbonate 26, BUN 26, creatinine 1.1, glucose 179.  CK 72
at the outside hospital, troponin of 0.9.  Electrocardiogram
with sinus rhythm at 74, left bundle branch block, normal
axis, ST elevations in V2 to V3 with depressions in V4 and
V5.  No significant change from outside hospital.  Chest
x-ray with mild congestive heart failure, no pneumonia.

IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 74 year-old female with cardiac
history and diabetes mellitus who presents with worsening
angina and acute chest pain radiating to the back and arms
and neck which has now resolved.

HOPSITAL COURSE:  1) Cardiovascular.  Chest pain was felt to
be consistent with acute coronary syndrome versus aortic
dissection especially with the history of aortic patch.
Patient was cycled with serial enzymes and did rule in for
myocardial infarction by enzymes, was continued on her
statin, Nitropaste and Imdur, on metoprolol and Zestril and
increased dose of Lasix for mild degree of failure.  On
[**2125-11-29**] patient developed 10 out of 10 chest pain
radiating to the neck with severe shortness of breath.
Vitals were 89 percent on 2 liters of O2.  She was then given
a nonrebreather, Lopressor 5 mg intravenous times two, 4 mg
of morphine, 2 mg of Ativan.  Her vitals were then 100
percent on nonrebreather with stable blood pressure and
pulse.  Laboratories showed troponin of 3.2, arterial blood
gases showing a gas of pO2 161, CO2 of 53.  Chest x-ray
showed bilateral pulmonary edema.  Patient was transferred to
the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.  She was
continued on heparin, nitro drip as well as all of her home
medications and no further episodes of chest pain.  Patient
underwent catheterization on [**2125-11-30**] which had a PTCA
and stent of the SVG to LAD and anastomosis distal to graft
touchdown.  SVG to RCA showed no evidence of stenosis.  There
was a tight ostial and proximal left circumflex which was not
stented secondary to dye load that was given and patient was
transferred back to the Cardiac Care Unit for monitoring
until further catheterization on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2125-12-3**].
Over the weekend she had no significant events and underwent
cardiac catheterization on [**2125-12-3**].  Cardiac
catheterization on [**2125-12-3**] with an attempt to
intervene on the left circumflex.  However, due to difficulty
passing wire through the left circumflex artery lesion there
was no intervention that was done.  Post procedure patient
was doing well.  However, after the sheath was pulled she
began to develop a large groin hematoma around noon on
[**2125-12-3**].  Patient had a significant groin hematoma
which began to expand, was given blood as well as several
liters of intravenous fluid.  The interventional fellow was
present and attempted to put pressure on the femoral artery.
However, the hematoma was large and the patient's body
habitus prevented adequate hemostasis.  Patient was
transferred up to the Cardiac Care Unit for evaluation and
treatment.  Arterial line was placed for further monitoring
of her blood pressure and patient was noted to be severely
hypotensive.  Blood pressure readings were difficult to
correlate with cuff measurements as patient's cuff
measurements were fluctuating wildly from 60 systolic to 120
systolic.  Arterial line measurements were the ones that were
used for evaluation and treatment.  Patient was started on
Dopamine as well as Levophed for increasing her systolic
pressure.  However, she was failing to respond to both of
these.  Over 4 liters of intravenous saline were given to her
with little improvement in systolic blood pressure.  Patient
was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory which was
performed as an emergent catheterization by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
with fellow [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 46**] present.  Left sided cardiac
catheterization showed occlusion 100 percent of the left main
coronary artery, SVG to the LAD was 100 percent occluded, SVG
to the RCA was not injected due to cardiac arrest.
Immediately upon establishing arterial accessed patient began
to develop refractory ventricular tachycardia and pulseless
electrical activity.  Attempt was made to PTCA the occluded
SVG to LAD but while preparing equipment patient became
asystolic.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and
patient coded for about 25 minutes.  Despite multiple doses
of intravenous epinephrine, atropine, calcium chloride,
bicarbonate patient remained in PA for more than 20 minutes
with no return of any visible cardiac activity by
fluoroscopy.  Code was called at 6:55 P.M.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Acute myocardial infarction.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.

Chief Complaint:
Fevers, diarrhea and knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 22221**] is a very nice 45 year-old genlteman with s/p
CRT '[**63**] on prednisone and rapamune, DM2, HTN, and gout who comes
with fever of 104 at home and knee pain. He was in his prior
state of health until 3 days ago when he noted a fever up to 104
at home. Then, a few hours later he noted brown watery diarrhea
up to 4-5 per day in large quantities, without any nausea, vomit
or abdominal pain. His cough has been at his baseline,
non-productive and he was able to do his daily activities. He
did not take any medications. He was able to have a few sips of
water, but in general he had very poor PO intake. He noted
decreasing urine output. Yesterday he started noticing R knee
swelling, with pain and some erythema in the skin that matched
with his prior gout flaires. He did not notice any improvement
and his fevers continued, so he decided to come to the hospital.

In the ER his pain was [**10-5**], T 99.6 F, HR 137 BPM, BP 96/64
mmHg, RR 30 X', SpO2 100%. His initial abdominal exam reported
severe abdominal pain and inflammed R knee joint. Patient
initially received Flagyl and underwent non-contrast abdominal
CT scan that did not show any perforation, obstruction or acute
pathology. Arthrosenthesis shwoed 16,600 WBC with 98% PMNs, no
organisms as well as few needle-shaped negatively birefringent
crystals. Pt received ""stress dose steroids"" with Solumedrol 125
mg. His CXR showed a RML infiltrate. At this point patient
received Vanc/Levo/CTX. His BP was as los as 90/60 mmHg and
tachycardia up to 130s. He responded to 4 L NS fluid. Given that
CT scan showed pericardial effusion, cardiolgy consult was done,
who performed an echocardiogram that did not show signs of
tamponade. No pulsus was done. Transplant surgery and nephrology
were called, but did not see patient. T [**Age over 90 **] F, BP 110/66 mmHg,
SpO2 96% 2L. he is being admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.

Of note, patient undergoes labs every other week at [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital and results get faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2106**] and his PCP. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**4-19**] his creatinine was 3.54, gap of 14 with Na 139, K 4.7, Cl
103, CO2 22, BUN 70. Pt had normal LFTs (AST 28, ALT 17), PTH
149,  urine creatinine 37 and protein 109, HCT 30, PLT 189 and
WBC 9.2. Rapamune level was 13.3.

Imaging Studies:

Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2183-4-24**]): Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a large
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief
right atrial diastolic collapse.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-7-11**], a
previously very small pericardial effusion is now large in size.
No clear echocardiographic evidence for tamponade.

CT abdomen/pelvis ([**2183-4-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate simple-appearing pericardial effusion, new since
[**2181-7-27**].
2. Bibasilar ground-glass opacities consistent with aspiration
pneumonia.
3. No evidence of small-bowel obstruction, free air or abscess
formation.
4. No abnormalities of the renal transplant on CT.
5. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

Duplex ultrasound ([**2183-4-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to [**2182-10-12**], there are sharper upstrokes and
increased, abnormal RIs of the transplant renal arteries,
concerning for rejection.
2. No evidence of abscess formation at the right iliac fossa
renal
transplant.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2183-4-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal predominantly basal airspace infiltrate with some
associated
atelectasis, concerning for infection. Follow up with CXR is
recommended.
2. Moderate-sized pericardial effusion.
3. No definate evidence for malignancy within the chest.
4. Healing seventh posterior right-sided rib fracture.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT [**2183-4-28**]
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a large
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There is
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired
ventricular filling.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-4-24**],
mitral inflow views suggest impaired filling. The size and
location of the pericardial effusion (mostly posterior) are
similar.

Cardiac Cath  [**2183-4-28**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Pericardiocentesis via the apical approach under
echocardiographic
guidance with confirmation of catheter placement via flouroscopy
and
injection of agitated saline was performed. The initial mean
pericardial
pressure was 14 mmHg, which declined to 8 mmHg after drainage of
320 cc
of clear red-tinged fluid.  Follow-up echocardiography
demonstrated
gross resolution of the effusion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful pericardiocentesis via apical approach.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT [**2183-4-28**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Prior to pericardiocentesis, there is a moderate to
large circumferential pericardial effusion.
Post-pericardiocentesis, there is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion located near the infero-lateral wall. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There is a very small pericardial
effusion; the pericardial space is somewhat echodense consistent
with probable organization. The pericardium appears thickened.
The echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of
pericardial constriction.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-4-28**], the
pericardial effusion is now much smaller.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2183-4-30**]
IMPRESSION: Removal of pericardial drain with increase in
cardiac diameter
and increased retrocardiac atelectasis, suggesting
reaccumulation of
pericardial fluid. Increasing left pleural effusion. The right
lung opacity
is unchanged and might correspond to a parenchymal opacity
adjacent to a known
rib fracture documented on the CT examination of [**2183-4-25**].

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT   [**2183-5-2**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2183-4-29**], no major change.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2183-5-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Finding suggestive of possible reaccumulation of pericardial
effusion.
2. Persistent large left pleural effusion with compressive
atelectasis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	[**2183-5-2**]
No pneumothorax is detected. Compared with [**2183-5-2**], no
significant change is
detected. Again seen is the loculated pneumothorax at the left
base, with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Also again seen is the
~26 mm
nodular opacity in the right mid lung -- ? related to healing
rib fracture, as seen on [**2183-4-25**] CT, vs an focal patchy
parenchymal opacity also seen on CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - CKD Stage IV at baseline with
creatinine of 2.5-3.0. He arrived with creatinine 5.1, elevated
from 3.5 the week prior. He had sharp upstroke of arterial
waveforms and increase of RIs compared to [**2182-9-26**], which was
initially concerning for possible rejection. The renal
transplant team was consulted and concluded that the most likely
cause was to pre-renal renal failure in the setting of diarrhea
and dehydration, with a contribution from the sirolimus level
being elevated. Sirolimus was stopped, diuretic medications were
stopped, he was given IVF and his AoCRF slowly resolved and
returned to baseline. He was started on myfortic once the
sirolimus levels were <8 and tolerated this medication without
side effects. Bactrim was not started while he was an inpatient
but a prescription for Bactrim SS was called in to his pharmacy
and the patient informed of this.

# Pericardial effusion - Patient was found to have new
pericardial effusion on presentation CT chest and then again on
echocardiogram. On initial TTE there were no signs of tamponade
and he was admitted to the MICU for closer monitoring. The
etiology was unclear and with broad differential. Multiple tests
were done to rule out infections, rheumatologic or malignant
processes and were all negative (see result section for specific
tests). Sirolimus was considered as a possible etiology for the
pericardial effusion as there had been case reports of this. He
was subsequently transferred to the floor were surveillance TTE
revealed early sign of tamponade. Due to this a cardiology
consult was obtained and the patient was taken to the cath lab
for urgent pericardiocentesis. He tolerated the procedure well
and was transfered to the CCU for monitoring. While in the CCU
he developed AF with RVR that was treated with IV diltiazem and
subsequently converted to NSR. He was then transfered again to
the medical floor were he remained stable and repeat TTE
revealed a trivail effusion. His BP meds were adjusted (see
medication section for details).

# Diarrhea - Patient with watery non-bloody diarrhea without any
sick contacts, nausea or vomiting. Initially he had pain in his
RLQ, where his transplant is located. Non-con CT scan did not
show acute pathology, but this study was limited given the lack
of contrast. Patient was treated with Flagyl and his symptoms
improved. Flagyl was stopped after 2 days of treatment and
symptoms did not recur.

# Pulmonary infiltrate - Patient had new infiltrate in RML
compared to prior CXRs. CT chest showed bibasilar ground-glass
opacities. Since he is immunosuppressed he is at risk of
atypical infections. Pt had initially elevated lactate of 2.7
that normalized with fluids 0.8. Induced sputum was attempted 3
times to check for PCP but this was unsuccessful. Patient was
started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern of aspiration
PNA. Additionally, he underwent video swallow study to assess
for aspiration risk. This showed no signs of aspiration and
flagyl was stopped. He finished a 9 day course of levofloxacin
and remained a febrile.

# Gout - Pt had a gout flare in the setting of dehydration and
possible infection. The right knee was tapped in the ED, fluid
analysis consistent with gout. No evidence of septic joint. Pt
received steroids in the ER and was continued on his home dose
of prednisone thereafter. His pain was treated with prn Dilaudid
and it resolved on HD4.

# Diabetes Mellitus type 2 - Last A1C of 5.9 on [**10-4**]. Patient
was continued on ISS. Glyburide was resumed when his clinical
status improved.

# Hyperlipidemia - LDL 52, HDL 66, Chol 153, TG 174.
Furthermore, statins have shown decrease rejection rate and
possibly better outcomes in in-hospital patients. We continued
his home dose statin during this admission.

# Hypertension - Pt on Toprol XL 100 and amlodipine 5 mg daily
at home. Initially his antihypertensives were held in the
setting of hypovolemia and ARF from diarrhea. Once stabilized,
he was started on metoprolol and this was titrated to HR/BP
control. He was discharged on 150 mg of metroprolol succinate
daily. Amlodipine was not restarted given that his BP was well
controlled with the above regimen and concerns of worsening his
LE edema.

# Secondary Hyperparathyroidism - Secondary to chronic renal
failure Stage IV. We continued his home calcitriol but the
dosing was changed to QOD.

# Anemia: Patient was found to be anemic but remained at
baseline. Iron studies revealed anemia of chronic disease with
likely contribution from CKD. Iron repletion was stated.
Treatment with epo should be considered as an outpatient.

Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male with
hypertension, prostate cancer (status post radiation
therapy), status post coronary artery bypass graft times four
in [**2116-7-15**] following a positive exercise tolerance
test and a catheterization which showed a 90% left main and
3-vessel disease.

During his hospitalization for his coronary artery bypass
graft, the patient developed new atrial fibrillation and
aspiration pneumonia, a left pleural effusion, and he also
received a right iliac stent during his catheterization.  He
was discharged to rehabilitation and then to home.

On [**2116-10-27**], the patient's visiting nurse noted that
the patient had a melanic stool.  The patient was then
admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital where he was noted to have an
infected sternal wound.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Hypertension.
 2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 3.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 4.  Prostate cancer, status post radiation therapy in [**2112**].
 5.  Glaucoma.
 6.  Right inguinal hernia repair.
 7.  Atrial fibrillation (new onset in [**2116-7-15**]).
 8.  Colon polyps.
 9.  Carotid stenosis.
10.  History of transient ischemic attack.
11.  Coronary artery bypass graft times four.
12.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post stent to the
iliac artery in [**2116-7-15**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
multivitamin, Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.d., Ambien, Humulin, captopril, amiodarone, Pravachol,
Cosopt, Alphagan, iron sulfate, Coumadin (held), Protonix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife at home with
[**Hospital6 407**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Temperature of 99.9,
pulse of 100, blood pressure of 162/62, oxygen saturation of
97% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient was in no acute
distress.  His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat were
unremarkable.  He had no icterus.  His neck was supple with
jugular venous distention.  He did have bilateral carotid
bruits.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His heart was
regular in rate and rhythm without murmur, rubs or gallops.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good
bowel sounds.  His extremities had no edema.  His right foot
had a healing ulcer on the bottom of his heel and over the
lateral malleolus.  His sternum incision showed erythema and
purulent and sanguinous fluid staining the dressing with a
small opening at the inferior portion of the incision.  The
sternum was not stable.  The rectal examination was
guaiac-positive.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories from
outside hospital revealed a white blood cell count of 17.4,
hematocrit of 32.8, platelets of 368 (85% polys, 6%
lymphocytes, 9% monocytes).  Sodium of 138, potassium of 4.1,
chloride of 96, bicarbonate of 28, blood urea nitrogen of 26,
creatinine of 0.9, glucose of 385.  INR of 7.4.  Urinalysis
was unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted the
Surgical Service.  On [**10-30**], the patient underwent
debridement and partial resection of his sternum.  The
sternum wires were removed.  There was evidence of sternal
dehiscence.  OR cultures and blood cultures grew out
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient
was placed on vancomycin.

He underwent an omental flap on [**11-11**].  This procedure
was delayed secondary to sepsis and hypotension requiring
pressors.  The patient was temporarily paralyzed and
intubated.  Following the flap reconstruction, the patient
remained intubated and developed a ventilatory-requiring
pneumonia.  A bronchoscopy on [**2116-11-19**] revealed a
pseudomass infection which was resistant to ceftazidime and
imipenem but sensitive to cefepime.

In terms of his gastrointestinal bleeding, an upper endoscopy
was performed on [**11-17**] which showed normal mucosa to the
duodenum.  The patient continued to have gastrointestinal
bleeding, however, and on [**11-27**] underwent a colonoscopy
showing angiectasia of the rectum and radiation proctitis;
however, this was not actively bleeding.

Other events of significance during his hospitalization
included direct current cardioversion on [**11-14**] for
atrial flutter.  The patient also had episodes of gross
hematuria.  Urology was consulted and recommended outpatient
followup.  The patient also developed a clot in the right
internal jugular that was identified by Doppler.  The patient
also developed bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient also
developed a splenic infarct while on pressors.

On [**11-30**], the patient was transferred from the Surgical
Service to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  It was felt that
his surgical issues had resolved.  However, the patient had
multiple medical problems at that time including failure to
wean from the ventilator, ongoing pneumonia, and pleural
effusions.

As far as his cardiac status at that time, he was noted to be
in some congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic
function.  He was placed on captopril at that time.

As far as his renal function, he had developed acute tubular
necrosis in the setting of hypotension from sepsis, and this
was slowly resolving.  He was grossly fluid overloaded,
however.

In terms of his neurologic status, he had generalizes
weakness and also had profound mental status changes.  He was
alert but not responsive and would not follow commands.

In terms of his gastrointestinal status, the patient was on
Protonix for his history of upper gastrointestinal bleed.
His hematocrit was stable at the time of his transfer to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  As far as his hematuria, he
continued to have intermittent hematuria attributed to Foley
trauma.

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
significant for his failure to wean off the ventilator and
for his change in mental status.

As far as his failure to wean, he was repeatedly attempted to
wean.  Despite adequate treatment of his pneumonia, the
patient would become extremely agitated and tachypneic on
trials of pressor support.

As far as his cardiac function, a repeat echocardiogram
showed moderately depressed systolic function, and the
patient was continued on amiodarone, Lopressor, and an ACE
inhibitor.

The patient was evaluated by the Neurology Service who felt
that his delta mental status was most likely multifactorial
in the setting of his medical problems.  [**Name (NI) 6**] magnetic
resonance imaging of the head showed no acute stroke or bleed
but had an old left cerebellar stroke and mild atrophy with
diffuse microvasculature ischemic changes and bilateral
mastoid air cell disease.

As the patient's condition did not improve despite aggressive
treatment, and given his multiple medical problems and his
overall poor prognosis, after an extensive discussion with
the patient's wife and her nieces, it was decided to withdraw
aggressive care and make the patient comfort measures only.
In this setting, the patient expired secondary to respiratory
failure and cardiac asystole on [**12-6**] at 5:43 p.m.

DIAGNOSES AT DEATH:
 1.  Status post sternal debridement.
 2.  Status post omental flap reconstruction of the sternum.
 3.  Congestive heart failure.
 4.  Ventilator-requiring pneumonia.
 5.  Respiratory failure.
 6.  Acute tubular necrosis.
 7.  Acute renal failure.
 8.  Insulin-dependent diabetes.
 9.  Change in mental status.
10.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.
11.  Radiation proctitis.

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old
male with known coronary artery disease who was admitted to
[**Hospital6 2910**] on [**2144-9-9**], for elective
cardiac catheterization.  Past medical history is significant
for coronary artery disease status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent of the left
anterior descending coronary artery in [**2138**].  Upon arrival to
the [**Hospital6 2910**], the patient reported
constant four out of ten chest pain with radiation to his jaw
since the previous evening, [**2144-9-8**].  He received
morphine prior to catheterization.  Catheterization
demonstrated a tight LAD lesion, 70% proximal, 90% mid LAD,
resulting in an inability to see his previous LAD stent.  The
patient continued to have chest pain status post
catheterization with no electrocardiogram changes evident.
Left ventriculogram during catheterization showed normal size
and good contraction of all wall segments.  He was started on
a nitroglycerin intravenous drip at 80 mcg/minute, Aggrastat
and heparin.  This resulted in a decrease in his chest pain
to one to two out of ten in severity.  Labs drawn at [**Hospital6 14475**] showed a hematocrit of 39.0,
creatinine kinase of 126, troponin 0.06.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
therapeutic catheterization.  Upon arrival vital signs were
97.8, blood pressure 140 to 160 over 90 to 100, heart rate in
the 60's with normal sinus rhythm, oxygen saturation 98 to
100% on two liters nasal cannula oxygen.  Prior to
catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**],
patient received fentanyl 25 mcg for his discomfort and
Versed.  Therapeutic catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**] showed left main coronary artery disease with
mid ostial disease, left anterior descending with 60% ostial
lesion, moderate 50% mid disease prior to stent, 95% tight
focal lesion in old stent prior to first major diagonal
branch.  A Cypher stent was deployed in the proximal/middle
LAD.  Status post catheterization, the patient had
serosanguinous blood discharge and ooze from around sheaths
upon arrival to the floor.  Tunnel sheaths were pulled with
systolic blood pressures in the range of 140's to 150's.
Cardiac fellow applied pressure.  The patient complained of
recurrent pain so additional doses of morphine were given.
At this time then his right groin developed a large hematoma.
Subsequently, nitroglycerin and Aggrastat were discontinued.
Intravenous fluids were started with aggressive fluid
hydration.  Stat hematocrit value was drawn with a value of
34.9.  The patient's hematoma continued to expand and he
continued to complain of pain.  As the hematoma and groin
continued to ooze bloody discharge, a vascular groin C-clamp
was applied.  The patient was transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit for further hemodynamic monitoring.  Upon arrival
to the CCU, he complained of severe pain, greater than ten
out of ten in severity.  Upon arrival he then received
another 10 mg of morphine, 1 mg of Versed, 50 mcg of fentanyl
and Phenergan 25 mg IV.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM [**2144-9-9**] AT [**Hospital6 **]:
Showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute.  Left axis
deviation.  Borderline PR interval.  Right bundle branch
block.  Left anterior fascicular block.  Poor R-wave
progression.  Poor voltage in limb leads.

CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**2144-9-9**]):  Demonstrated selective
left-sided coronary angiography in this left dominant
circulation demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery had a 30% ostial lesion.  The
left anterior descending had serial lesions, with a tubular
60% proximal, 50% mid prior to the old stent, mild in-stent
re-stenosis leading into a 95% lesion at the distal end of
the stent.  The left circumflex had mild luminal irregularity
and gave off an OM1 with moderate diffuse disease.  The right
coronary artery was not engaged.  Successful stenting of the
main left anterior descending was performed with a 3.5 x 18
mm Cypher (drug alluding stent).

ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2144-9-10**]):  Left ventricular ejection fraction
60%.  The left atrium is normal in size.  Left ventricular
cavity size and systolic function are normal.  The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets (three)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation.  The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal.  No mitral regurgitation is seen.  The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a small pericardial effusion.  There is no 2-D
echocardiographic findings of tamponade, but a complete
Doppler assessment was not possible.

ARTERIAL DOPPLERS OF THE RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ([**2144-9-10**]).
Duplex evaluation performed of the right lower extremity
arterial and venous systems with concentration on the
inguinal region.  Impression was that of a large right groin
hematoma.  There was no evidence of obvious pseudo-aneurysm
or arteriovenous fistula.

REPEAT RIGHT VASCULAR ULTRASOUND OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY
([**2144-9-4**]):  Again, there was a large right femoral hematoma
which demonstrates heterogeneous echotexture.  The right
common femoral artery and vein are patent demonstrating
normal vascular flow.  There is no evidence of
pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient with known history of
coronary artery disease status post coronary catheterization
times two on [**2144-9-9**], status post stent placement in
the proximal/mid left anterior descending artery.  Plan was
made to continue aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor and folate.  It was
unclear originally why the patient was not on a beta blocker.
Therefore, once his blood pressure was able to tolerate
additional antihypertensives, a low dose beta blocker was
added to his medication regimen.  We started him on
metoprolol, titrating up the dose to desired effect.
Initially many of the patient's antihypertensive medications
including Catapres and Accupril were held secondary to the
questionable hemodynamic instability resulting from his right
groin hematoma and blood loss anemia.  After stabilization of
his intravascular volume status post multiple transfusions,
and several days of monitoring, the patient was restarted on
metoprolol and captopril.  After several days of monitoring,
the patient continued to be hypertensive with blood pressures
ranging 160 to 180 over 90's to 100.  Therefore the doses of
the captopril and metoprolol were titrated up.  The captopril
was switched to longer acting lisinopril.  At the time of
discharge the patient's blood pressure was controlled on
metoprolol 100 b.i.d., lisinopril 40 q. day and
hydrochlorothiazide 25 q. day.

The patient continued to be monitored on telemetry with no
evidence of acute conduction abnormalities.  After the
complaint of chest pain on the first day of admission with no
demonstrable electrocardiographic changes, the patient
remained chest pain free for the remainder of this admission.

2.  Right groin hematoma resulting in blood loss anemia:
Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained status post
coronary catheterization and development of large right groin
hematoma.  Vascular Surgery recommended a lower extremity
ultrasound with results as above, namely, ultrasound
demonstrated a large right groin hematoma, no evidence of
pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.  In the
Coronary Care Unit, serial hematocrits were obtained,
patient's blood pressure and hemodynamics were checked
serially and peripheral pulse checks were done q. one hour.
Due to anemia secondary to blood loss, the patient required
multiple blood transfusions for stabilization of his blood
volume and maintenance of hematocrit greater than 30.  All
told he received five units of blood.  Initially also he was
kept on bed rest with Foley catheter in place and his right
leg immobilized.  His pain was treated with morphine,
fentanyl and Versed initially.  After several days it was
switched over to Vicodin as the patient uses Vicodin at home
for control of his lower back pain.  Repeat ultrasound was
obtained on [**2144-9-4**], with no evidence of hematoma
expansion, no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous
fistula formation.  Upon discharge, the patient's hematoma
size was stabilized.  Serial hematocrits had been stable
above 33 to 36 for several days.  As the patient's hematoma
resolved within a prolonged period of immobilization, it was
felt that discharge to a rehabilitation facility where he
could work on functional mobility and increasing gait and
balance was warranted.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Fair.  Right groin hematoma size
stable.  Hematocrit stabilized.  Unable to demonstrate full
pre-hospital functionality, so discharge to rehab.

with goal of increased functional mobility.  He is instructed
to please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**] one to two weeks after
discharge from the rehabilitation program.  He can call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 25832**] for an appointment and was given this
information.  Additionally, he was told to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] for
a follow-up appointment at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2394**] within the following
two to three weeks.  The patient was instructed that we have
changed several of his pre-hospital medications, particularly
those controlling his blood pressure.  He was instructed to
discard his Catapres patch, Lasix and Accupril prescriptions.
He was instructed that we have added metoprolol, lisinopril
and hydrochlorothiazide to his blood pressure regimen.  He is
instructed to take them as directed.  Additionally, he was
instructed that he must take daily aspirin and Plavix for the
next nine months.  He was instructed that if he misses any
doses, the risk of his coronary stents occluding dramatically
increases.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58 year old male with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, status post allo bone marrow
transplant in [**2146-4-5**] with a very complicated course.  The
patient has had line bacteremia times two in [**Month (only) 205**] and now
presents with six to eight weeks' of intermittent progressive
rash.  The patient was seen in clinic the last several weeks.
The rash was believed to be initially a drug reaction to
Vancomycin and Bactrim.  However, the rash continued to get
worse.  The patient was started on steroids with the belief
that the rash was due to graft versus host disease. In the
days prior to admission, the patient is spiking fevers up to
103 and also complains of watery diarrhea.  He also has cough
productive of yellow sputum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in [**2135**], status
post allo bone marrow transplant in [**2146-4-5**].
2.  Diabetes mellitus, steroid induced.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Gout.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1   Prednisone 30 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  CellCept [**Pager number **] mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Pentamidine.
4.  IgG q.monthly.
5.  Atarax.
6.  Magnesium.
7.  Folate.
8.  Prilosec.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed a temperature of
99.7, heart rate 110, blood pressure 108/60, respiratory rate
24, oxygen saturation 94% on four liters.  General - Alert,
ill appearing, in no acute distress.  The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Dry mucous membranes.  Positive oral
thrush.  The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular is tachycardic, hyperdynamic, no murmurs.  The
lungs revealed wet crackles bilaterally.  The abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ pitting edema.  Skin is diffusely
erythematous and desquamating.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
2.0, hematocrit 33.0, platelet count 49,000.  Unremarkable
Chem7.  Liver function tests are remarked for alkaline
phosphatase of 770 and LDH 421.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the
regular medical floor with fevers and watery diarrhea.  He
received fluids with no significant improvement.  He also had
some broad spectrum antibiotics including Cefepime,
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  On the medical floor,
the patient continued to have worsening hypoxia which was not
improving despite numerous medical interventions.  He was
then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit after he
developed hemoptysis and hypoxia with oxygen saturation
unable to improve on noninvasive ventilation.  Initial gases
revealed acidosis with mild hypercapnia and good oxygenation.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was placed on non-
invasive mask ventilation with the hope that this would improve
his pulmonary status. His presumptive diagnosis was diffuse
overall hemorrhage based on the fact that he is a post bone
marrow transplant patient and on his hemoptysis.  The patient had
previously very clearly stated that he is DNR/DNI and did not
wish any intubation.  He did not improve after four days of non-
invasive mask ventilation with at times worsening hypoxia and
hypercapnia. He was maintained on all antibiotics and no clear
source of infection was identified.  On [**2146-9-28**], the patient
developed an episode of hypotension that was not responding to
fluids. He became hypoxic and required increased FIO2 to 100.
Despite repeated fluid boluses, he went profoundly
hypotensive and his mental status was declining.  After
discussion with the family, the decision was made to make the
patient comfort measures only.  The patient was started on
Fentanyl drip and expired at 11:05 on [**2146-9-28**].

Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower lobe lung cancer


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-12-15**]: Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage,
right thoracotomy and right lower lobectomy with sleeve
bronchoplasty (tubular bronchoplasty of the right middle lobe
for reanastomosis), mediastinal lymph node dissection,
intercostal muscle flap buttress, and pericardial flap buttress.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with a right lower lobe
squamous cell carcinoma with endobronchial invasion at the level
of the superior segment and distal bronchus intermedius. He had
undergone previous cervical mediastinoscopy which was negative
for any mediastinal nodal disease. He then underwent 8 weeks of
pulmonary rehab. He symptomatically felt much better though his
post rehab pulmonary function tests were still severely impaired
with an FEV1 of 47% of predicted and a DLCO 50% of predicted.
His cardiopulmonary exercise testing, however, revealed a VO2
max of 21.8 mL/kg per minute.  He was admitted for lobectomy or
possible bilobectomy with the help that we could simply do a
right lower lobectomy; but in order to get an adequate bronchial
margin, this would likely require a tubular bronchoplasty or
reanastomosis of the right middle lobe onto the bronchus
intermedius.


Past Medical History:
1.  COPD, currently undergoing pulmonary rehab to pursue
surgical
resection of the right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma.
2.  History of pneumonia treated with antibiotics as described
above.
3.  Abdominal hernia
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Cervical spine surgery.  The details are not available to us
at this time.
6.  Basal cell carcinoma.
7.  History of polypectomy in [**6-/2118**] on colonoscopy. 3-cm as
well as a 1 cm inflammatory polyp.


Social History:
The patient is married and accompanied by his wife. [**Name (NI) **] has two
children. 80-pack-year history of tobacco. He quit approximately
three months ago. Prior heavy alcohol consumption; he quit at
the time of his diagnosis. He worked in a nuclear power plant in
[**Location (un) 3320**], [**State 350**] for approximately 24 years. The patient
describes having significant radiation exposure during that
period of time.


Family History:
There is no family history of any carcinomas.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2124-12-15**] and taken to the OR for flexible
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, right thoracotomy and
right lower lobectomy with sleeve bronchoplasty (tubular
bronchoplasty of the right middle lobe for reanastomosis),
mediastinal lymph node dissection, intercostal muscle flap
buttress, and pericardial
flap buttress. A paravertebral catheter was placed for pain
control w/ PCA w/ excellent effect. 2 chest tubes were placed at
the time of surgery for drainage and to assist w/ lung
re-expansion.

[**Name (NI) **], pt was admitted to the ICU for invasive respiratory and
hemodynamic monitoring.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is from Poland and moved to the
United States in [**2088**].  She has been married for over fifty
years.  No ETOH, tobacco or drug history.  Most recently, she
has resided at [**Hospital **] Nursing Home.  Minimal verbalization
at baseline since cerebrovascular accident.  Her daughter is
very involved in her care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 96.6,
heart rate 96 and in atrial fibrillation, blood pressure
106/42 with a MAP of 63, CVP of 6, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 100% on 50% face mask.  Examination is
notable for thin elderly woman looking acutely ill.  Surgical
pupil on the right.  The pupil is reactive on the left.
Sclera anicteric, mucous membranes are moist.  Strong gag.
No jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy. The heart is
irregular and rapid, no murmurs.  Lungs revealed coarse
breath sounds and diffuse rhonchi.  The abdomen is soft,
nondistended, nontender, gastrostomy tube in place.
Extremities showed no edema, 2+ pulses.  Neurologically,
dense hemiparesis of the right side with upgoing toe on the
right and downing toe on the left and moving left extremities
without difficulty.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
14.8, hematocrit 44.0, platelet count 350,000.  Chem7 was
normal except for glucose of 149, CK 167, troponin 0.04.
Urinalysis notable for many bacteria, [**12-8**] white blood
cells, moderate leukocytes.

Chest x-ray revealed retrocardiac density and bibasilar
atelectasis.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at
137 beats per minute, left axis deviation, 0.[**Street Address(2) 11725**]
depressions V3 and V4, T wave inversion in leads I and aVL.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious disease - The patient was initially started on
broad spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and
Flagyl in the setting of sepsis.  Eventually, urine cultures
grew resistant proteus and sputum cultures grew Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli.  Her antibiotic
coverage was eventually changed to Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone
to which she responded well.  She should complete a ten day
course of each.

2.  Cardiac - Pump - The patient was initially septic and dry
on admission and was treated aggressively with multiple
boluses of intravenous fluids.  She subsequently developed
evidence of pulmonary edema, not surprisingly since her
ejection fraction is 20%.  She was then started on Lasix for
diuresis which eventually evoked hypotension and she was felt
to be dry.  Total length of stay she is positive eight liters
in the Intensive Care Unit.  At this point, her goal is even
fluid balance. She will be restarted on her baseline Lasix.

Rate - The patient was in rapid atrial fibrillation on
admission, unclear of the duration of her atrial
fibrillation, however, she has never been anticoagulated per
primary care physician because of risk of falls.  The patient
had a left middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident in
[**5-21**], thought to be embolic in nature.  She has not been
anticoagulated since that time due to concern for rebleed.
Atrial fibrillation has been controlled initially with
Diltiazem drip but she was then changed to p.o. beta blocker
with good rate control with heart rate in the 80s.  The
patient was started on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous twice a day
for anticoagulation.

Ischemia - The patient had non ST elevation myocardial
infarction in the setting of sepsis and rapid atrial
fibrillation.  Electrocardiographic changes resolved with
heart rate control.  The patient was continued on Aspirin,
beta blocker and Lipitor.

2.  Status post cerebrovascular accident - According to the
family, the patient has been only minimally verbal since
cerebrovascular accident.  They do feel that they can
communicate with her and understand what she is trying to
communicate.  There seems to have been little improvement in
her function since [**Month (only) 116**].

3.  Access - The patient had a right IJ placed on admission
which remained throughout her hospital course.  She had no
erythema or infection felt to be associated with the line.

4.  Code Status - Code on admission, the patient was full
code.  She never did require intubation or CPR.  Multiple
discussions with the family were undertaken while the patient
was in the Intensive Care Unit with the result that the
patient was made DNR/DNI as documented on [**2129-12-10**], in the
chart.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient will be discharged to an
extended care facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should continue
Vancomycin intravenously until [**2129-12-17**].  She will continue
Ceftriaxone or p.o. equivalent to end on [**2129-12-21**].  In
addition, she should continue on Lovenox for anticoagulation
and her beta blocker should be titrated for adequate heart
rate control.  Tube feeds to be continued and the patient
will need physical therapy.  In addition, her weight should
be monitored closely for evidence of weight gain at which
time her Lasix should be intermittently increased.  The
patient may also require chest physical therapy
intermittently to help handle her secretions.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Bisacodyl 10 mg p.r.n.
2.  Atorvastatin 10 mg once daily.
3.  Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.r.n.
4.  Atrovent nebulizer p.r.n.
5.  Insulin sliding scale.
6.  Albuterol nebulizer p.r.n.
7.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. once daily.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

ABDOMEN U.S. (PORTABLE)  [**2102-12-22**] 11:21 AM

FINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
There is no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.2
cm. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The
gallbladder is partially filled with sludge, but there are no
signs of cholecystitis. The pancreas is mostly obscured by
overlying bowel gas. The spleen is not imaged on this exam. The
right kidney measures 11.1 cm and the left kidney measures 10.4
cm. There is no hydronephrosis and no solid masses are
identified in either kidney. There is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm
simple cyst identified in the lower pole of the right kidney.
There is no ascites identified but there is a right pleural
effusion seen.

Grayscale and Doppler images of the aorta in the midline are
very limited due to the patient's overlying bowel gas. There is
some flow in the aorta, but it is difficult to assess. At its
widest diameter, the aorta measures 4.2 x 4.5 cm. The surgical
graft is not identified on this examination. Arterial flow is
identified in the right kidney with appropriate waveforms in the
hilum. No flow is identified in the left kidney, but this may be
due to the fact that the left kidney is more difficult to
visualize.

IMPRESSION:

1. Very limited views of the aorta show some flow within it.
Evaluation of the graft is not possible on this examination due
to the patient's abdominal distention and bowel gas.

2. Sludge in the gallbladder with no signs of cholecystitis.

3. Right pleural effusion.

[**2102-12-21**] 12:37 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest (two exposures to cover
entire chest area) were obtained with the patient in supine
position and analyzed in direct comparison with a similar
preceding study of [**2102-12-19**]. The heart size remains
within normal limits. The thoracic aorta is identified including
the bulging portion in the distal lower portion of the thoracic
aorta, which previously had been identified at the beginning
site of the thoraco-abdominal aneurysm. On previous examination,
linear atelectatic markings of the left lung have regressed
markedly and there is no suspicion for any remaining major
atelectasis or pulmonary infiltrates surrounding the repaired
aneurysmatic area. Also, the right basal densities have
decreased and the right lateral pleural sinus is free. No new
parenchymal infiltrates are identified and no evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestive pattern exists. No pneumothorax.
Previously described right jugular approach central venous line
in unchanged position terminating overlying the superior
mediastinum at the second anterior rib junction.

Markedly improved postoperative chest. Lateral view could give
information concerning possibly remaining posterior pleural
fluid.

4. Small simple cyst in the right kidney

[**2102-12-21**] 2:56 PM

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed. There is
normal compression, color flow, waveforms, and augmentation.
There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the lower
extremities.

[**2102-12-21**] 5:50 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: assess anastomotic sites/ assess for infiltrates/ fluid
[**Last Name (un) **]

FINDINGS: Significant increase in mediastinal lymph node size is
present at all mediastinal and hilar stations including the
right upper paratracheal, from 4.4 to 9 mm, right lower
paratracheal, from 4 to 10 mm and from 5 to 11 mm, and in
subcarinal area, from 7 to 16 mm. This increase might be
reactive to infection and/or aspiration new since both the
[**11-15**] CT and chest radiograph earlier today, specifically
right perihilar, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe areas
of peribronchial infiltration and more peripheral
consolidations. The airways are patent to the level of
subsegmental bronchi but endobronchial secretions in the
bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe and segmental bronchi
might represent aspiration.

Left lower lobe linear opacity most likely is due to atelectasis
secondary to small pleural effusion. The right pleural effusion
is also noted, small as well. The patient is after right lower
lobe surgery, most likely wedge.

The heart size is enlarged with small pericardial effusion,
nonhemorrhagic, new compared to [**2102-11-15**]. Myocardial
density is significantly higher than the density of the blood in
the left ventricle suggesting anemia. Large thoracic aortic
aneurysm up to 6.7 cm in diameter is grossly unchanged, 6.5 cm
on the previous study, representing known fusiform thoracic
aortic aneurysm.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen is limited for
evaluation due to the absence of oral and IV contrast. The
gallbladder is distended up to 4.2 cm. The abdominal aorta is
only partially imaged with a new fluid collection in front of
it, 2:74, nonhemorrhagic by measurement of its radiodensity.
There is no free intraperitoneal air, clips at the level of the
SMA most likely related to recent surgery.

A stent in the left carotid is noted, unchanged. There are no
bone lesions suspicious for malignancy. Healed fracture in the
fifth right rib most likely related to thoracic surgery.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited assessment of post-surgical changes due to incomplete
evaluation of the operation site and absence of oral contrast.
2. Pre-aortic fluid collection of unknown clinical significance.
If clinically warranted, further evaluation with
contrast-enhanced study is recommended.
3. New right middle and right lower lobe consolidations
consistent with infection versus aspiration. New bilateral small
pericardial effusion.
4. Unchanged descending thoracic aorta aneurysm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 43933**],[**Known firstname 177**] [**Numeric Identifier 43934**] was admitted on [**2102-12-12**] with  AAA. He
agreed to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, he was
consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were
obtained,  all other preperations were made.

He underwent a Right iliofemoral conduit placement and SMA-ilio
right and left renal artery bypasses with ligation of the origin
of the SMA and right and left renal arteries. This was done in
preleration of an endovascular procedure to be scheduled in the
future.

He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, he was transfered to the CVICU for further
care. Pt was eeventually weaned from pressure support and
extubated. Once stable from the initial surgery, pt was
transfered to the VICU for further management.

While in the VICU he recieved monitered care. When stable, he
was delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained.

It was noticed that the pt had an increase in his LFT. A
transplant surgery consult was obtained. Pt received a RU US.

IMPRESSION:

1. Very limited views of the aorta show some flow within it.
Evaluation of the graft is not possible on this examination due
to the patient's abdominal distention and bowel gas.

2. Sludge in the gallbladder with no signs of cholecystitis.

3. Right pleural effusion.

4. Small simple cyst in the right kidney

On DC his LFT are in a downtrend. Transplant ok'd for Dc with no
follow -up. Py diod have serial abdominal exams. Much
improvement.

PT also was thought to have VT arrest. He was resusitated
without intubation. A cardiology and EP consult was obtained.

The final consensus was - Upon review of tele/ECG's episode
consisted of sinus tachycardia in setting of baseline IVCD with
multiple PVCs

He was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative care,
he was transfered to floor status.

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. He was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in stable condition.

To note pt has to follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for furthe
treatment of AAA.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year-old
female who back in [**2128**] had developed a sudden onset of pain
in her neck.  She was evaluated by her primary care physician
and was sent for an exercise tolerance test and the patient
had an myocardial infarction and developed congestive heart
failure.  She was started on medications and did well until
[**2129-3-9**] when she again had an episode of shortness of breath.
At this time she underwent a catheterization and angioplasty
and stent placement of her right coronary artery.  She has
done well since then and recently in [**2134**] she had increasing
of shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and had an
exercise tolerance test, which was positive.  The ischemia
though occurred much quicker and she underwent cardiac
catheterization again, which showed coronary artery disease.
Catheterization results were left anterior descending
coronary artery 60 to 70% stenosis, left circumflex 80%
stenosis and right coronary artery 60 to 70% stenosis.  She
now presents to [**Hospital1 69**] for
coronary artery bypass graft.

congestive heart failure, insulin dependent diabetes times
twenty years and endometrial cancer recently diagnosed.  She
had recent vaginal bleeding and was evaluated by her Ob/Gyn
physician and found to have endometrial cancer.  She will be
treated at [**Hospital3 3834**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41922**], phone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 41923**] after her coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for status post
appendectomy, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy,

of regular for dinner and 16 of NPH at bedtime.

ALLERGIES:  Percocet, which causes nausea and vomiting and
Vioxx, which causes a gastrointestinal upset.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a retired teacher.  She lives alone.
She has no tobacco or ETOH history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is an obese white female
in no acute distress.  Her weight is 113 kilograms.  Blood
pressure is 168/91.  Skin is within normal limits.  Pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light.  Oropharynx is clear.
Neck she has no bruits.  No evidence of jugulovenous
distention.  Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and obese.  She had no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities.  The patient
is alert and oriented times three.  She has 1+ distal pulses
bilaterally.

Her electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm with a rate of
60 with a normal axis.  No evidence of ischemia, though she
has a history of atrial fibrillation.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.4,
hematocrit 38.4, platelets 343, PT 12.4, PTT 21.6, INR of
1.1.  She has a sodium of 142, potassium 4.5, chloride 96,
bicarbonate of 30, BUN of 31, creatinine 1.2, glucose 184,
AST 21 and LDH of 268.  Her preop PA and lateral showed no
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient on the day of admission went to
the Operating Room and underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times three off pump.  She had a left internal mammary
coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein
graft to posterior descending coronary artery.  She was
transferred to the Recovery Room with a mean arterial
pressure of 65, CVP of 22 in normal sinus rhythm with a rate
of 53 on Propofol at 30 micrograms per kilogram per minute,
neo 0.5 micrograms per kilogram per minute, insulin at 1.

Postoperatively in the Intensive Care Unit she required
multiple boluses, but remained hemodynamically stable.  She
was also given some _________ ______ 500 cc.  She remained on
neo, which was weaned and remained with a cardiac output of
greater then 4 with a cardiac index of around approximately
2.  She was extubated in the evening of the first
postoperative night, which she tolerated well.  Chest tubes
remained in 20 cm of water.  She was also continued on an
insulin drip overnight.  She remained stable the next morning
and was transferred to the floor for the remainder of her
recovery.  On postoperative day number two her JP chest tube
and wires were discontinued.  On postoperative day number
three she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response.  She was given Lopressor po.  Her
electrolytes were repleted.  Her blood pressure remained
stable in the 120s, 140s/70s.  She was loaded with
Amiodarone.  She then on postoperative day number three again
had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.  Her blood
pressure remained stable at 138/75.  She was given Amiodarone
and Lopressor and her rate responded appropriately.

She was started on Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.
Currently her INR is 2.5.  She remains in sinus rhythm.  On
postoperative day number 7 after beginning anticoagulation
the patient developed some vaginal spotting.  Given her
history of endometrial cancer, a Gyn consult was obtained.
Their evaluation was that the bleeding was stable.  There was
no need to proceed to hysterectomy at this time.  They
suggested the patient be continued on anticoagulation and
will be followed up by her Gyn in six months and that her
condition is likely stable.  The patient's anticoagulation
was continued.  She is therapeutic.  She remained in sinus
rhythm.  During this time she is also been evaluated by
physical therapy.  She is currently at a level activity of 3.
She has remained hemodynamically stable and is now ready for
discharge to rehabilitation.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Detrol, Procardia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient was
in no acute distress.  Vital signs:  The patient's vital
signs were stable, afebrile.  HEENT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  EOMI, PERRL, anicteric.  The throat was clear.
The neck was supple, midline.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm
without murmur, rub, or gallop.  Notable for left carotid
bruit.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  Warm, noncyanotic, nonedematous times four.
Neurological:  Grossly intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for coronary
artery bypass grafting times four.  The procedure was
performed on [**2102-12-26**] and complicated in the immediate
postoperative period by bleeding.  The patient was taken back
to the Operating Room for reexploration.  A mammary artery
bleeder was identified and controlled.

Subsequent to this, the patient was taken to the ICU for
close monitoring.  The patient was transfused 8 units of
packed red blood cells, 2 in the OR, 9 units of fresh frozen
plasma, 3 units of platelets, 1 unit of cryo.

In the ICU, the patient was extubated without difficulty on
[**2102-12-28**].  An episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with
conversion back to normal sinus rhythm with 5 mg of IV
Lopressor and 150 mg IV Amiodarone.

On postoperative day number four, the patient was transferred
to the floor.  On postoperative day number five, the patient
went into sustained rapid atrial fibrillation but was
hemodynamically stable, converted to normal sinus after 10 mg
of IV Lopressor and 400 mg of p.o. Amiodarone.
Anticoagulation was then begun for recurrent atrial
fibrillation episodes.  The sternal wound was seen to be
draining serosanguinous for a number of days and Plastic
Surgery was consulted on postoperative day number 13.

The patient was deemed a good candidate for flap procedure
for wound breakdown and transfused 4 units of fresh frozen
platelets preoperative.  A pectoral advancement flap was
performed on postoperative day number 14.  Wound cultures
sent at that time ultimately grew coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus and probable Enterococcus from the superficial
swab.  The deep swab remained without growth.  The patient
was maintained on Levaquin, vancomycin and Flagyl subsequent
to the flap procedure.  The patient was monitored in the ICU
and had an uneventful course.

Subsequently, the patient was again transferred to the floor
on postoperative day number 19 with the left IJ central
venous line noted to be nonfunctioning.  This line was
changed over a wire with an x-ray showing coiling of the new
CVL, probably secondary to pectoral flap.  The CVL was then
discontinued and re-sighted to the right subclavian.

The patient then had an episode of sinus bradycardia which
was evaluated by Cardiology.  They thought this to be part of
a ""tachy/brady syndrome"".  They recommended no changes in
management except to avoid negative dromotropic and negative
chronotropic drugs.  Lopressor was stopped.

The patient, after this, had an uneventful course and was
maintained with wound dressing changes per Plastics and JP
drains for drainage.  The JP drains were discontinued and
prior to discharge, a right PICC line was placed and the CVL
was discontinued.

The patient had some difficulty with constipation but did
move his bowels the evening prior to discharge.  The patient
was tolerating a regular diet and adequate pain control on
p.o. pain medications.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  Rehabilitation facility.

DIET:  Cardiac and diabetic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Percocet 5/325 one to two q. four hours p.r.n.
2.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to continue dry
sterile dressing changes to wound b.i.d.  PICC line care per
protocol.  The patient should have an aggressive bowel
regimen, and may require Fleets enemas due to long-standing
constipation.  Vancomycin levels should be checked around the
third dose and every week after documented therapeutic
levels.  The patient should continue physical therapy with
strengthening and respiratory therapy including incentive
spirometry.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, this is a 74 yr old with relatively
unremarkable past medical history who went into V.Fib arresst at
home and was shocked out of rhythm by EMS in field. After
stabilzation of pt. in the [**Name (NI) **], pt. found to have pumonary
embolism and ?pneumonia/increased WBC. He was started on Heparin
for the PE and abx for increased WBC. PNA. Pt. remained
intubated until [**6-5**] when he was successfully extubated. During
this time ([**Date range (1) 56879**]) pt was followed by medicine, cardiology,
nutrition, etc. and had numerous studies performed
(CXRs,CTs,Cultures-blood,urine,sputum,Echos,etc.). Finally on
[**2190-6-7**] pt underwent a cardiac cath which revealed severe LMCA
and mult. vessel disease. An IABP was placed and pt was
scheduled for a CABG the next day. On [**6-8**] pt was brought to the
OR and underwent a CABG x 3. Pt. tolerated the procedure well
with a total bypass time of 65 minutes and cross-clamp time of
54 minutes. Please see op note for full surgical details. Pt was
transferred to CSRU in stable condition with a MAP of 85, CVP
16, PAD 16, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] 23, and HR 88 A-paced. He was being titrated on
Neo and propofol. Later on op day pt was weaned from mechanical
ventilation and propofol and was succesfully extubated. He was
awake, alert, mae, and following commands. POD #1 pt's IABP was
removed. Neo was weaned and diuretics and b-blockers were
started per protocol. He was started back on Heparin and
Coumadin. On POD #2 his chest tubes, epicardial pacing wires,
and foley catheter were all removed per protocol. POD #[**1-28**] pt
with ?aspiration. Speech study performed showed thin liquid
aspiration. Remained in the CSRU until POD#4 when he was
transferred to telemetry floor. Cont. to have course bs bilat.
Pt. encouraged to get OOB and ambulate. POD #[**4-30**] pt cont. to
progress slow d/t ambulation limitationa from polio. He was
cont. on Heparin and Coumadin for PE/A.Fib and Vanco for asp.
PNA. POD #7 pt was doing well, but needed transfer to Rehab
before going home. He was transferred there on heparin,
coumadin, and vanco. His physical exam was much improved with 1+
edema and irregular rate and heart rhythm. Appropriate follow-up
appointments were made.

CT ABD/PELVIS W/CONTRAST10/16:
1. Prior Puestow procedure with minimal surrounding stranding,
nonspecific.
2. Decrease in size of cystic lesions in the region of the
proximal pancreas are likely residual pseudocysts.
3. Lymphadenopathy, as above.
4. Progression of lower lumbar spine degenerative changes, as
above.

CXR [**10-21**] IMPRESSION:
Broken sternal wires. Small bilateral pleural effusions and
underyling
collapse/consolidation. Mild assymetric upper zone
redistribution.

ERCP [**10-23**] Impression: Cannulation of suspected minor papilla
superficially with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.

Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification
of thin, irregular pancreatic duct.
Due to altered anatomy, redundant folds and edema, the major
papilla was unable to be located for cannulation.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: Return to floor
Continue with current antibiotic therapy for [**10-19**] day course
Consider pancreatic protocol CT scan to further delineate the
pancreatic/biliary anatomy as patient is unable to get MRCP due
to defibrillator.
Pending resolution of current inflammation, would consider
repeat ERCP in [**1-8**] weeks if clinically indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin,
COPD, CHF, chronic pancreatitis s/p Puestow procedure and
cholecystectomy, admitted with cholestatic LFTs and abdominal
pain with hypotension on admission c/w biliary
obstruction/cholangitis with sepsis.
.
.
# Sepsis d/t biliary obstruction/cholangitis: Patient presented
with hypotension, fever, leukocytosis and abdominal pain
consistent with sepsis. BP initially 70s-80s in ED but was fluid
responsive.  Now hemodynamically stable, doing well on
antibiotics, see below.
.
# Biliary obstruction/Cholangitis -
Pt was initially managed in the ICU and was treated aggressively
with Vancomycin and Pip/Tazo. ERCP and Surgery were consulted.
He clinically stabilized, with improvement in blood pressure
after bolusing IVF, and providing antibiotics.  He underwent
ERCP attempt [**10-23**], but they were unable to cannulate the major
papilla. He was continued on antibiotics and his LFT's were
closely followed.  Despite inability to complete the ERCP, his
LFT's continued to downtrend, and the patient symptomatically
improved, with resolution of abdominal pain.  He remained
hemodynamically stable, and his blood pressure medications were
able to be resumed prior to discharge. He will complete a 10 day
course of Cipro/Flagyl for his cholangitis (7 days remain).
Considering his clinical improvements, the pt will pursue
further [**Month/Year (2) 2742**] and management as an outpt, which will likely
include CT Pancreas, and repeat ERCP once the inflammation has
decreased. Pt should have LFT's/CBC drawn at a follow up PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **].
.
# Urinary tract infection - Patient had a positive UA, but Ucx
from [**10-21**] had no growth. Thus, it is unlikely that it was the
source of his infection or reflective of bacteremia.
.
# ETOH abuse: Pt denies h/o withdrawal although drinks on a
fairly regular basis. Counseled at length the need for him to
quit.
He was monitored on the CIWA scale, but did not score. There was
no evidence of withdrawl.
.
# CAD: He denies CP during this hospitalization although he
reported CP in the ambulance and at the OSH ED. He stated that
this was dissimilar from ""cardiac"" pain.  Cardiac enzymes were
checked and were negative. He was provided aspirin 81 mg PO
daily.  His blood pressure medications were initially held due
to his sepsis, but these were resumed prior to discharge and
were tolerated well.
His Crestor was held, and will be held on discharge until PCP
follow up, considering his elevated LFT's from his biliary
obstruction. Please follow up and resume when appropriate.
.
# Atrial Fibillation: Pt currently in afib, rate controlled.
Pt's metoprolol was resumed on [**10-25**], which he tolerated without
difficulty. Pt's warfarin was initially held for ERCP, but this
was resumed prior to discharge. Please see results section for
recent INR's and warfarin dosing.
His warfarin was resumed on [**10-24**];  please note the interaction
with the antibiotics.  His INR will need close following.
Discussed with patient the need for close INR monitoring,
especially while on antibiotics. Pt agrees to go to his coumadin
clinic [**10-26**] for INR check.
.
# COPD: pt reports being on Combivent at home, although this was
not on his medication list from the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]. He denied any
respiratory symptoms.
He was discharged on his home regimen.
.
# BPH: resumed flomax
.
# Gout: continued allopurinol
.
# GERD: Continued PPI
.
# Psoriasis/Arthritis:
His methotrexate was held considering infection.  He was
continued on folic acid.  He was provided Clobetasol Propionate
0.05% Cream 1 Appl TP [**Hospital1 **] for 2 Days and Calcipotriene 0.005%
Cream 1 Appl TP [**Hospital1 **] for 2 Days, with reported benefit.
He was requested to f/u with his PCP for management of his
psoriasis medications after the hospitalization.

polys, 0 bands, hematocrit 28.4, platelets 220, lactate 5.9.
UA negative for infection.  Chest x-ray showed no evidence of
infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) SEPSIS:  The patient was initially
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for sepsis as the
suspected source of the right antecubital fossa
thrombophlebitis versus cellulitis.  He was treated with IV
vancomycin and had a central line placed.  His quickly
defervesced.  He was seen by vascular surgery who felt that
there was no indication for urgent operation at this time,
and he improved within 48 hours, and was transferred to the
medical floor.

2) STERNAL WOUND DEHISCENCE:  The patient was seen by
cardiothoracic surgery and plastic surgery for a sternotomy
dehiscence after his coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2148-4-5**] where
his sternum was repaired with a pectoralis muscle flap.
Please see the operative notes from Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 70**].  The patient did well postoperatively without any
significant complication.  However, he developed CHF and was
transferred to the cardiology service.

3) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient has baseline of
systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 30-35%.  After his sternal wound repair, he was developing
worsening congestive heart failure secondary to
intraoperative and perioperative IV hydration.  The patient
also developed a hyponatremia and was transferred to the
cardiology service for diuresis.  He was started on
nesiritide drip and made excellent progress with a negative
fluid balance daily, and an improvement in his creatinine.
He was quickly changed over to oral lasix and was continued
on his qd ACE inhibitor and Toprol XL.  On the day of
discharge, the patient's CHF regimen was Toprol XL 200 mg qd,
lisinopril 40 mg qd, and lasix 20 mg qd.  The patient will
follow-up with his cardiologist and will follow-up with his
primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2 days of discharge to reassess
his volume status.

4) CHEST PAIN:  The patient had postsurgical chest pain and
was initially treated with a PCA without any basal rate.
After several days, the patient was changed over to oral
narcotics and was slowly weaned.  However, throughout the
admission the patient continued to complain of chest pain,
while at the same time getting up, walking around the floor,
and asking for additional narcotics and benzodiazepines.  The
patient had multiple EKGs checked during his episodes of
chest pain.  He never had any EKG changes consistent with
ischemia.  His vital signs remained stable during his
episodes of chest pain, and his episodes of chest pain were
felt to be solely due to musculoskeletal pain.

The patient was seen in consultation by the psychiatry
service and was instructed to follow-up with psychiatry.
However, the patient has refused to follow-up with psychiatry
in the past.  Even on the day of discharge, the patient
complained of chest pain as he was being told that he was
being discharged.  An EKG was checked at that time, and there
were no changes on his EKG compared to his baseline EKG from
[**2148-3-22**].  His EKG only showed evidence of prior
inferior ischemia and nonspecific, stable ST-T segment
changes.  The patient reports having had multiple admissions
to multiple hospitals in the [**Location (un) 86**] area over the past
several months, and has stated that he has spent very few
days not in a hospital.  By report, he has had these multiple
admissions for noncardiac chest pain.

5) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient does, however, have
a long history of coronary artery disease and has had
coronary artery bypass graft surgery with a LIMA to LAD, and
an SVG to PDA.  The patient did not have any active ischemia
during this admission, and was continued on his cardiac
regimen consisting of aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, Toprol XL,
and lisinopril.

6) DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIOR:  During his admission, the patient
continuous showed drug seeking behavior.  He would complain
of chest pain that was so severe that he could not move.
However, he did not receive any narcotics for his chest pain.
He would then get up out of bed and walk around the floor
requesting additional pain medication from nursing staff and
house staff.  At this time, he would be walking around the
floor in no apparent distress, other than appearing angry
because he could not receive any narcotics.  In addition,
when discussing his discharge, the patient initially refused
discharge even when he was deemed medically stable for
discharge.  He felt that his pain would not be controlled as
an outpatient and was demanding prescriptions for percocet,
ativan, Ambien, and morphine.  The patient was given the
telephone number and the name of the psychiatrist who saw him
in consultation, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21722**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 47576**], and was
instructed to follow-up with him.  The patient was given a
prescription for 2 week's worth of Ambien 10 mg tablets 1
tablet po q hs, and he was given a prescription for 15
percocet tablets prn 1-2 tablets q 8 h for pain.  He was
instructed to follow-up with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2
days, as scheduled, at 11:30 am on [**4-18**], to talk about
pain control.

7) DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient is a type 2 diabetic and
was admitted on oral agents.  During this admission, the
patient was maintained on glargine and Humalog insulin
sliding scale with assistance from the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes
specialist.  However, the patient on discharge was unsure if
he would be able to do Humalog insulin sliding scale.  He
ideally would use glargine qd, and use a somewhat simplified
sliding scale.  However, given his complicated medical
regimen and his limited medical compliance, the patient was
discharged with instructions to follow-up with his primary
care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 days to institute a simplified diabetes
regimen that will control his blood sugars as much as
possible, while also creating a regimen that he will be able
to follow and comply with.

8) HYPONATREMIA:  The patient was hyponatremic on admission
and has a baseline sodium in the low to mid 130 range.  After
developing postoperative CHF, his sodium dropped to 126.  The
sodium level responded to fluid restriction and diuresis, and
on the day of discharge the patient's sodium was 131.  The
patient was discharged on his CHF regimen including lasix,
and was instructed to maintain a fluid restriction of 1.5
liters qd.

9) JP DRAIN:  The patient's surgical wounds were followed by
plastic surgery team while in-house.  On the day of
discharge, he had one remaining indwelling JP drain that was
draining approximately 180-250 cc/d.  He was instructed on
how to care for this drain, and how to empty it.  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-23**] at 10:00 am for removal of
the drain and removal of the sutures.  He was given a
prescription for po Keflex 500 mg po qid to take while he has
this JP drain in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Non ST-segment myocardial infarction- The patient was
admitted CCU after ruling in for a NSTEMI. The etiology is
unclear, but it occurred in the setting of SBP > 200.  Patient's
nausea, vomiting, and throat pain were likely anginal
equivalents. He was treated with aspirin, beta-blocker,
IIb/IIIa, heparin and lipitor. Tight glucose control was
obtained with an insulin drip.  Given patient's high risk TIMI
score, cardiology  suggested that patient proceed with
catherization. Given his  creatinine of 5.0, nephrology was
consulted. Nephrology concluded that there was a  significant
risk that the patient may require life-long dialysis if he
proceeded with catheterization. The patient decided to defer the
catherization procedure to an outpatient procedure. Patient
wanted time to discuss treatment options with his nephrologist,
Dr. [**Known firstname **].  The patient continued to be treated medically
with goal of normalizing blood pressures and glucose levels.
After the patient was stablized on the medical floor, a
pharmacologic stress test was performed which showed no angina
or EKG changes at peak exertion.  The perfusion scan was w/o
focal abnormalities but with the non-specific finding of
dilation with stress (? 3 vessel disease).  Given that the
patient was free of sx, he chose to defer catheterization.

2. DM- On admission, patient was found to be in DKA. He was
placed on on an insulin drip, with resolution of anion gap
metabolic acidosis. The patient was followed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
Diabetes Center endocrinologist. He was transitioned to insulin
sliding scale.  He was eventually restarted on his outpatient
dose of NPH with the ISS. Blood sugars were high intermittently,
but urine remained neg for ketones and gap was normal. Glucose
control was well-controlled on discharged on NPH (16, 18). He
was advised to follow-up at the [**Hospital **] clinic as an outpatient.

3. Hypertension- On admission, blood pressures were over 200.
During the course of his hospitalization, Labetolol was
increased to 800 mg tid. Losartan 30 mg was added to blood
pressure regimen. Patient's PMD was consulted, and acknowledged
that pressures have also been difficult to treat as an
outpatient. At time of discharge BP was 120/70 on Labetolol 800
tid, hydralazine 50 qid and nifedipine 90. He was instructed to
follow up with his PMD.

4. Renal Failure- Patient's renal failure was thought to be
pre-renal and a result of both, vomiting and dehydration. During
hospitalization Cr decreased from 5.1 to 4.5.  He was also
discharged on epo injections.

5. Peripheral Edema- patient was gently diuresed on last two
days of hospitalization.
He was discharged on Lasix 20 mg [**Hospital1 **].

6. Addison's: He was maintained on fludrocortisone 0.1 and
hydrocort 20 qAM, 5 qPM

Service:  [**Hospital1 **] MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 83-year-old female, with
multiple medical problems including diabetes, hypertension,
heart failure, COPD, and a history of CVAs, who has been
experiencing dysphagia over the past year.  She presented to
[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital initially, after she began choking on
a dinner of Chinese food.  A day prior, she had had
hematemesis, as well as some chest pain.  She was seen for an
initial evaluation at [**Location (un) **] where she was taken to the
endoscopy suite.  An EGD revealed a 10 cm esophageal [**Location (un) 1994**]
with bleeding consistent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**], and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation for concerns of
esophageal perforation.

On arrival, a gastrografin bowel study was obtained that was
negative for perforation.  Chest x-ray was negative, as well.
The the gastroenterology service was consulted.  Her initial
management was supportive with blood transfusions, and
empiric antibiotics.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction
via serial enzymes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  An elderly female presenting with acute
esophageal mucosal [**Last Name (LF) 1994**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] variant, explaining
her presenting bleeding.  Likely, she has other esophageal
pathology such as peptic strictures from longstanding
gastroesophageal reflux disease.  In her initial course, she
was treated supportively with blood transfusion to keep the
hematocrit greater than 30%, given her underlying coronary
artery disease.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction via
serial enzymes.  She was treated with empiric antibiotics
including ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Following
blood product support, she remained hemodynamically stable
without further evidence of bleed.

Given her hemodynamic stability, the consultation with the
gastroenterology service, a repeat EGD was felt not to be of
utility on this admission, due to the inability to dilate in
the setting of this [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**].  Rather, a diagnostic
EGD after four to six weeks of esophageal rest, with proton
pump inhibitor prophylaxis, will allow for better
visualization, and perhaps tissue diagnosis.  While this is
likely a stricture, other processes cannot be ruled out, such
as masses or carcinoma.

Her hospital course was also notable for two days of
delirium.  This was in the setting of ativan.  Her mental
status cleared with discontinuation of the benzodiazepine.
She had no further issues in this regard subsequently.

With respect to her hypertension, her antihypertensives were
reinitiated upon achievement of hemodynamic stability.  Her
blood pressure was well-controlled subsequently.

With respect to her diabetes, she is on a reduced dose of
insulin, as her PO tolerance steadily increases.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1994**].  2)
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  3) Diabetes mellitus, type
2.  4) Coronary artery disease.  5) Congestive heart failure.
6) Hypertension.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  1) The patient will be discharged to
extended care facility.  2) Her diet should consist of soft
consistency foods/diabetic foods for the next 6 weeks.  3)
She needs to be kept on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], for
example Protonix 40 mg po bid.  4) Her hematocrit should be
monitored on a qod basis to insure hemodynamic stability.  5)
Her fingersticks should be monitored qid.  6) The patient is
currently on 10 U of NPH in the am and 15 U of NPH in the pm.
As her PO tolerance increases, can titrate up to a home dose
of Insulin:  25 U NPH, 5 U regular in am; 35 U NPH, 5 U
regular in pm.  7) Refrain from giving patient nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories or COXII inhibitors.  Also, hold Plavix
and aspirin for now.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27082**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 29810**] who is the patient's primary care
physician and cardiologist.  The patient will need a repeat
EGD in 6 weeks.  She may follow-up at [**Hospital1 18**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**]
[**Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Given the fact that she lives
quite a distance from [**Hospital1 18**], she can follow-up this EGD
closer to home if she prefers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for increased
cholesterol who presented to our hospital who presented for
several days of malaise, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and
dizziness.  The patient was OB+.  She had a Hartmann in her
40's and was found to be hypotensive.  She denies any chest
pain or shortness of breath.  Electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 11741**] depression in V2 and V4 and ST elevations in 2, 3, and AvF
as well as complete heart block.  The patient was started on
IV heparin and then became apneic and hypotensive in the
emergency room. This required intubation and administration
of dopamine.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization, but has now become hypotensive on admission
and still in complete heart block.  She had a left heart
catheterization which revealed 95% of left anterior
descending stenosis and 100% occluded left circumflex which
was stented.  She was also found to have a small RC not
supplying a large part of myocardium.  After this cardiac
catheterization, the patient has hypotension with an episode
of supraventricular tachycardia.  All of these stopped with
the initiation of intra-aortic balloon pump.  In addition on
doing cardiac catheterization, the saturations in the left
and right side of the heart suggested presence of
atrioventricular septal defect.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives alone.  No smoking
or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.7, heart rate of
105, blood pressure was 126/50.  Respiratory rate is 20,
oxygen saturation is 98.  The patient is intubated and was
generally nonreactive to stimuli.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and
throat: Pupils are small, but equal and reactive to light.
Mucus membranes are dry.  Neck:  Difficult to appreciate
jugular venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy is palpable.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, obscured heart sounds.  Chest:
Good breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft and nontender
and normal active bowel sounds. Extremities:  No edema.  Good
bilateral pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for CK of 159, MB of 15, index
of 10 and troponin of 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for close observation monitoring. Immediately upon
admission, she had a TU which revealed anteroseptal defect.
The initial impression was to try to close this with a clam
shell procedure which is going to offer her best chances of
stabilizing a hemodynamics given that she became to be very
hypotensive.

However, discussion with the family, they decided that they
did not want any procedures done. The patient's blood
pressure remained extremely labile requiring a few pressors
in the beginning with fair satisfactory result.  Initial
subsequent echocardiogram revealed that she had global left
ventricular hypokinesis.  She was started on aspirin, Plavix
and maintained on IV heparin. She was also started on
Lipitor.  Initially, we could not start a beta-blocker given
her complete heart block and hypotension.  However, this
subsequently improved.  This was added to her regimen.  To
further improve her hemodynamics upon arrival to the CCU she
received large amounts of fluid and became about 15 liters
positive.  However, this increased preload and had
significant improvement in her hemodynamics and initially was
tolerated.  After while she became volume overloaded without
evidence of compromising her oxygenation.  This volume
overload was gradually improved with gentle diuresis and
sometimes with autodiuresis.  Once the condition improved,
she was started on Captopril which she tolerated a small
dose.  The balloon pump was stopped and had no significant
effect on her hemodynamics.

On hospital day #4 and #5, it became apparent that the
patient was aseptic which is the cause of her continued
hypotension.  She required pressors for about 10 consecutive
days, but eventually was able to be weaned off completely and
maintained good blood pressure.  In terms of rhythm, the
patient remained most of the time in first degree AV block
and notable in complete heart block with tachycardia in the
unit.  However, she did have one episode of atrial
fibrillation in the context of ventilatory weaning.  Because
of this, she was started on amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q. day.
She had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.  She is
also being anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation and for low
ejection fraction with akinetic ventricle.

2. Infectious disease:  There were multiple consults
involving infectious disease.  The patient was probably
aspirated during episodes of nausea and vomiting in the
outside hospital and particularly given the findings on
x-ray.  Sputum showed multiple organisms including gram
positive cocci and gram negative rods, but none of these were
grown. She received a 14 day course of levofloxacin and
Flagyl with marked improvement in her symptoms.
Additionally, the patient had 2 out of 4 blood cultures
positive for staph.  Both local lines were stopped and she
received a 14 day course of IV vancomycin.  Upon discharge,
all of her infectious disease issues has been resolved and
she has no evidence of being infected at this point.

3.  Renal:  Upon admission, the patient may be in very mild
acidosis which could have an myocardial infarction. This
improved.  She was being diuresed while in the hospital
course. She had a mild increase of creatinine and this is
probably normal and to be expected.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient initially had very labile blood
sugars in the 300 to 500 range.  She required initiation of
IV insulin drip and this was continued for at least 4 days.
This patient was getting better and was changed to a standing
NPH insulin.  It is quite likely that she has unrecognized
underlying diabetes mellitus that has not been treated. She
will probably require further follow up for this condition.

5.  Pulmonary:  The patient was initially intubated for
protection.  She had a very prolonged and complicated course
including inability to wean over a week, pneumonia and fluid
overload.   On hospital day #10, the final attempts to
extubate the patient was successful and she remained very
stable from respiratory standpoint and positioned to room air
shortly thereafter.  She has no acquired pneumonia and was
able to breathe comfortably on room air at this point.

6.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had some episodes of
bleeding from the oropharyngeal tract, but this is believed
more to be due to injury from the TE and intubation rather
than any gastrointestinal bleed.   Consultation of ENT was
obtained.  There is no continued gastrointestinal bleeding
from the gastrointestinal tract.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Plavix 75 p.o. q. day indefinitely.
2. Aspirin 325 p.o. indefinitely.
3. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q. day to be switched to 200 mg
p.o. q. day in about 3 to 4 weeks.
4. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day.
5. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day, this may need to be readjusted
for proper INR.
6. NPH 60 units in the morning, 10 units at night.
7. Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Acute myocardial infarction.
2. Status post catheterization.

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Multiple ICH, status epilepticus


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
55y male known to have seizure disorder, cocaine abuse, ETOH
abuse, transferred from Caritas [**Hospital6 5016**] (CHFH) with
status epilepticus.
He was known to be a daily Cocain sniffing abuser, and seemed
that he abused it last night, too.
According to the family, they heard large thump approximately
3AM
this morning, and found that the patient was down on the floor
under the stairs. He was unresponsive, mumbling (?). Family took
him to couch, which he could cooperate partially. They called
his
older sister to ask to come in. Around 4:30AM, sister came and
thought that he might have one of his regular seizure (once
monthly GT seizure). He was snoring loudly.
Since he did not wake up over several hours, family called EMT.
Upon arrival, EMT suctioned small amount of vomit from his mouth
and transfered to CHFH. There he was found to have continuous
acitivity of generalized tonic seizures and in status. He was
paralyzed, intubated and sedated. He was loaded with Dilantin.
Head CT showed bilateral thalamic hemorrhage, midbrain
hemorrhage, right frontal ICH, traumatic? SAH with collection of
blood in the lateral ventricles and brain contusion at bilateral
temporal lobes.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.
At arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was persistently seizing on and off,
received Propofol to stop seizure. The seizure stopped but
dropped BP to 80/40, Propofol was discontinued. But afterwards,
no visible seizure at ED besides, occasional tonic posturing
when
he was touched for exam.
Patient was admitted to ICU Neurology service for further
seizure
and ICH management.

ROS:
Cocaine abuse daily. Once per month base regular seizure. No
fever, no cough, diarrhea, recent sickness.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
Seizure disorder
Burns (from [**Location (un) 3786**] [**Doctor Last Name 4048**] fire, aprox 80%, skin grafted at [**Hospital1 2025**])

skin grafted at [**Hospital1 2025**]), ETOH abuse, Cocain abuse (daily basis,
last intake last night?) Per family, admitted to psych hospital.


#1 Bilateral thalamic hemorrhage, R frontal lobe homorrhage.
Mechanism likely to be hypertensive 2ndary to HTN by Cocaine
abuse. Control BP (SBP 120-160) and control seizure.
LP showed intracranial HTN (OP 32.5), blood. Control seizure,
withdrawal to avoid ICP elevation. Neurosurgery consulted at ED,
will follow up Pt.
- [**2-2**] Stable repeat CT. Continue to be rigid, unresponsive,
unstable VS, trendeling up CK (983). Suspected for Neuroleptic
Malignant Syndrome (NMS). Started on Dantrolene 0.25mg/kg/dose
(15mg/dose) q12h.
- [**2-3**] Titrate up Dantrolene to 0.5mg/kg/dose (30mg/dose) q12h,
started Bromocriptin 2.5mg q6h.
  Patient rigid, shiverring, febrile--> Withdrawal (ETOH,
Cocaine?) +/- NMS: Midazolam drip titrate up (2.5mg/h)

MRI [**2-10**]: Stable or improved bithalamic hemorrhage, R frontal
hemorrhage. No stroke. MRA unremarkable.

#[**11-22**] Neuroleptic malignant syndrome +/- ETOH withdrawal
Pt continuous to be rigid, febrile, unstable VS/HR, elevated CK.
Suspected for NMS, started on Dantrolene.
- [**2-3**] Toxicology consult: Likely to be NMS due to severe
rigidity (more than ETOH withdrawal). But certainly coexists.
Use sedative Propofol (x due to hypotension) or Midazolam drip
(safely upto 110mg/h). Will see pt [**2-4**] (Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 10753**], [**Pager number 72300**])
- [**2-3**] Psych consult:malignant hyperthermia?
- [**2-5**] Dantrolene increased to 3mg/kg/dose q12h (6mg/kg/dose)
- [**2-6**] Dantrolene increased to 4mg/kg/dose q12h (6mg/kg/dose),
Bromocriptine 5mg q6h.
- Dantrolene redistributed to 2mg/kg/dose q6h

#2 SAH, IVH, bilateral temporal lobe contusion Mechamism likely
to be traumatic. Same as above.

#3 Status epilepticus
Loaded with Dilantin, with current PHT level 13.2. Will continue

on 100mg q8h iv. Midazolam prn seizure. EEG continuous bedside
monitor was requested to Neurophysiology team.
Decide further AED management based on EEG, clinical findings.
- [**2-2**] EEG no seizure activity (occasional spike at bitemporal
lobe)--> will continue PHT 100q8.
- PHT level daily
- EEG portable [**2-4**]: L frontotemporal discharge, disorganized BG
- PHT 5.7 loaded 500mg, increased to 150TID.

#[**Street Address(2) 72301**] on CIWA protocol.
- [**2-3**] Will manage withdrawal symptom by Midazolam drip (upto
10mg/h) and dc Ativan.
- DC Midaz drip. Started on Ativan 2mg q6h. Go slow for Benzo
weaning.

#5 Fever
Start on Antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir). BCx,

UCx, CSF Cx need to be followed up.
- Fever got better after Dantrolene and Bromocriptin were
started.
- [**2-9**] 101F, cultured. [**2-10**] Started on Clindamycin for
pansinusitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Community Acquired Pneumonia/Sepsis/Respiratory failure:
Initially admitted to the ICU, as was transferred intubated.
Treated with IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Improved rapidly and extubated, transferred to the floor on the
hospital medicine team.  He was transitioned to oral
antibiotics, weaned off oxygen and continued to do well.  He
showed no overt evidence of aspiration, but did not undergo a
formal swallow evaluation because of the holiday weekend and his
eagerness for discharge.  He was advised to discuss a barium
swallow with his primary physician and schedule an evaluation at
his/her discretion.  His recurrent pneumonia may be related to
his underlying lung disease rather than aspiration.  He will
finish a total of 14 days of antibiotics, discharged on
cefpodoxime and azithromycin.  His sputum culture, urinary
legionella antigen and blood cultures were negative for a
source.

MICROBIOLOGY:
blood cultures from [**10-4**], [**10-5**], [**10-16**] and [**10-17**] NO GROWTH
dialysis fluid cultures [**10-4**], 10/14/ [**10-17**] NO GROWTH
TTE [**10-4**]:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
.
CXR [**10-4**]:
1. PULMONARY EDEMA VERSUS VOLUME OVERLOAD.
2. Asbestos exposure
.
Plain films right and left feet [**10-4**]:
1.  Chronic or subacute fracture of the distal aspect of the
first proximal phalanx on the left.
2.  No specific radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.  MR
would be more
sensitive for detection of osteomyelitis if clinically
indicated.
.
LE Doppler (arterial) [**10-5**]:
Doppler evaluation was performed on the bilateral lower
extremity
arterial systems at rest only.
On the right, the Doppler tracings are monophasic at the femoral
level and
this is the only level that was checked.  The ankle-brachial
index was unable to be obtained and the pulse volume recordings
are markedly decreased and in fact flat at the thigh, calf,
ankle, and metatarsal level.

On the left, the only Doppler tracing that was obtained with a
monophasic left femoral tracing.  The ABI was unable to be
obtained and the pulse volume recordings are flat at the thigh,
calf, ankle, and metatarsal level.

IMPRESSION:  There is a severe flow deficit to both lower
extremities from the level of the femorals distally.  This is
likely secondary to aortoiliac
occlusive disease.
.
[**10-6**] TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the
descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No ASD or intracardiac thrombus seen. Complex,
mobile atheroma of the descending aorta.
.
[**10-6**] Left Foot MRI:
Images are limited by motion.  There is edema in the dorsal
lateral soft tissues.  There is no abnormal signal within the
osseous structures to suggest osteomyelitis.  There is no joint
effusion. What is visualized of the tendons and ligaments of the
ankle are normal. There is degenerative change of the first MTP
joint.

IMPRESSION:  Dorsolateral soft tissue edema of left foot without
evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
[**10-11**] CT Aorta/Bifem/Iliac:
1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm with extensive atherosclerosis is
present in the entire vasculature of the abdomen and the lower
extremities.  There is an aortobifemoral graft with complete
occlusion of left limb as well as occluded and retrograde
filling of the left internal and external iliac arteries.

2.  Fem-fem graft with luminal thrombus causing almost 30%
narrowing of the
graft with extensive atherosclerosis and calcific plaque causing
significant attenuation of the vasculature of the lower
extremities as described above.

3.  Atrophic small kidneys with multiple cysts in keeping with
the known
diagnosis of chronic renal failure.

4.  Ventral abdominal hernia with loops of bowel without
definite evidence of bowel obstruction.

5.  Grade 3 spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 level.
.
[**2135-10-17**] EGD: Impression: Erosions in the gastroesophageal
junction compatible with esophagitis; Abnormal mucosa in the
stomach;
Erythema in the duodenum compatible with duodenitis; Protruding
lesion vs. thickened fold found near papilla in 2nd portion of
duodenum.
Additional notes: GI bleeding likely secondary to erosive
esophagitis at GE junction. Abnormal appearing polypoid lesion
vs. thickened fold at papilla could not be adequate visualized.
Next step would be evaluation with side-viewing scope and EUS if
patient/family wish to pursue workup.

Benefit of anticoagulation needs to be weighed against risk of
re-bleeding given esophagitis. Would favor low INR goal if
possible, once patient is further stabilized.

.
[**2135-10-17**] CT Chest w/out contrast
IMPRESSION:
1.  18 mm nodule in the left lung apex is concerning for
possible lung cancer
and less likely apical scar. PET CT is recommended for further
evaluation.

2.  18 mm rounded lesion at the right lung base most likely
represents rounded
atelectasis; however, this finding, and the adjacent pleural
thickening, can
also be evaluated at the time of the recommended PET CT to
exclude neoplasm.

3.  Resolving posterior segment right upper lobe and superior
segment right
lower lobe pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia.

4.  Dilated esophagus containing an air-fluid level.

5.  Increased peritoneal fluid since the [**2135-10-11**] examination.

6.  Partially imaged aortic stent graft; however, this study was
not designed
to evaluate stent patency.

7.  Large ventral hernia, incompletely imaged.

8.  Extensive atherosclerotic disease within the imaged aorta
and coronary
arteries.
.
[**2135-10-18**] RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right internal jugular, axillary,
brachial, basilic, and cephalic vein demonstrate normal flow,
compressibility, augmentation, waveforms.  No intraluminal
thrombus identified.  CVL is noted within the left subclavian.
IMPRESSION: No right upper extremity DVT identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
77-year-old gentleman with ESRD, PVD, DM, and CAD with RLL
pneumonia and necrotic toes.  Transferred on [**2135-10-4**] from OSH w/
RLL PNA and sepsis. He was also evluated for revascularization
options for ischemic digits in his lower extremities from his
PVD. A TEE showed complex atheroma in his aorta and he was
started on heparin gtt and coumadin. On [**10-17**] he became
hypotensive to SBP 70s-80s associated with an episode of coffee
ground emesis and guaiac positive stool and he was transferred
to the MICU. He was given IVF and 1U PRBC and his
anticoagulation was stopped. An upper endoscopy showed erosive
esophagitis at the GE junction but no brisk bleeding. His Hct
and blood pressure remained stable, and he was subsequently
called out to the floor for further management. On the floor he
was monitored and anticoagulation was restarted. He remained
stable with but began refusing medications and care, saying he
wanted to die. On [**10-23**] a family meeting was held and it was
determined that he would be taken home with VNA services for
care. On [**10-25**] he passed melena. His anticoagulation was held.
He was monitored overnight- his HCT and vitals were stable, and
he did not pass melena again, so given that his family was
anxious to take [**Last Name (un) **] home, he was discharged with plan to follow
up with his PCP the next day ([**2135-10-27**]) with his scheduled
appointment.
.
# SEPSIS
Patient met clinical criteria for sepsis in MICU, with fever,
hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate. Patient was
given a 14 day course of Vanc/Zosyn to cover both pneumonia and
soft tissue infection, to which he responded well. Patient never
required pressors.  A LLE MRI was negative for evidence of
osteomyelitis (although the study was somewhat limited due to
lack of gadolinium).  His blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] were never
positive.  He also received 5 days of stress dose steroids for
concern of relative adrenal insufficiency.
.
# LE NECROTIC TOES
Patient's exam was notable for non-dopplerable DP pulses and dry
gangrene of toes on both feet.  He was evaluated by vascular
surgery with a CT of his aorta/iliac/femoral vessels and then by
a lower extremity angiogram.  There was no stentable lesion
identified on angiogram.  Cardiology consult assessed the
patient to be high risk for a high risk procedure, and it was
decided not to pursue revascularization.  As he did not show
evidence of having infection in his lower extremities, it was
decided to continue wound care of his feet rather than to
amputate at present.
.
# MOBILE ATHEROMA
Mobile atheroma of the descending aorta was noted on TEE done to
evaluate sources of possible thromboemboli to necrotic toes.
The patient was started on a heparin gtt and then switched to
coumadin. Coumadin was held for GI bleed (see below) but
restarted once resolved. At the time of discharge the coumadin
has been held given 1 episode of melena [**10-25**] and INR 2.8, goal
INR 2-2.5. Plan to f/u with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the day after
d/c, to adjust anticoagulation accordingly.
.
# DELIRIUM
During the patient's MICU admission, he had waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status and at times became agitated.  His delirium was felt to
be multifactorial, including infection, ICU admission.  He
received haldol with good effect.  By the time he was on the
medical floor, he remained alert and oriented, although there
were times when he would try to get out of bed despite his
necrotic toes.  Haldol was not needed.
.
# ESRD on PD
Patient was followed by nephrology.  He received alternating
1.5% and 2.5% dialysis baths to help with fluid removal after he
was discharged from the ICU. Renal team planned to discuss
dialysis with his PCP/nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# DEPRESSION
Patient had reportedly tried Paxil for depression as an
outpatient.  This was stopped when his wife clarified that the
paxil had been making him drowsy and hence he had no longer been
taking it at home.
.
# DM
Although the patient is on oral agents at home, he was given
insulin during his admission, especially since the 2.5% dialysis
bath increased his insulin requirement.  He was switched back to
his home regimen lantus 6u qhs, but because of decreased po
intake was changed to half dose, 3u qhs.
.
# CARDIAC
A. CAD
The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**], who reported that the patient
has had MI x 2 in the past, but is not aware of any PCI or CABG.
 Patient was put on aspirin and a low dose beta blocker as
tolerated by his BP.  [**Name (NI) **] wife reported that the patient's
statin had been stopped by a doctor in the past; she was not
sure why. On the floor the patient was started back on ASA 1
week after resolution of GIB (see below), and statin. BB was
held as his SBPs were ~100s. ASA was held [**10-25**] due to 1 episode
of melena. It is recommended that the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 2 weeks after GIB
before restarting ASA.
.
B. RHYTHM
Patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation without rapid
rhythm.  He was put on heparin drip and then switched to
coumadin.  He was also started on a beta blocker.
.
C. PUMP
Echo demonstrated preserved EF, though the patient was felt to
have chronic diastolic heart failure.  Although he was volume
overloaded after being treated for sepsis in the MICU, he
remained euvolemic after the extra volume was removed by
dialysis.
.  .
# Upper GI bleed: Did not appear brisk.
GI performed EGD showing erosion of gastric esophageal junction.
He was transfused 1 unit pRBC, and hct responded appropriately
23 - 26 and remained stable. Coumadin and ASA were held, but
after 1 week of remaining clinically stable were restarted. On
[**10-25**] he had an episode of melena, coumadin and ASA were held.
He was monitored overnight, his HCT the next day remained stable
around 26, he was hemodynamically stable and his family was
insistent that he leave, so he was discharged home with plan to
f/u with PCP the next day.
.
# lung nodule and duodenal polyps - were observed on CT (see
report), recommended for PCP to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u as outpatient.
.
The patient was discharged in stable condition [**2135-10-26**].

History of Present Illness:
43 year old male, with history of IV drug abuse
(cocaine/oxycontin) and hepatitis C, presents from OSH after
experiencing fevers, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and
malaise.

Hx is somewhat limited secondary to patient's lethargy.  Per
patient and girldriend, he has been having fevers at night for a
little less than a week, with night sweats.  His girlfriend took
his temperature 2 nights prior to admission and was found to be
103.2.  Over the last few days he has felt ""tired"" but continued
to use IV drugs and drink ETOH. Patient drinks 1-2 liters of rum
daily and shoots cocaine and oxycontin. Last drank alcohol 3
days prior to admission. Last used cocaine 3 days prior to
admission and last used oxycontin 1 day ago. Patient was trying
to self detox and describes becoming very ill last time he
attempted detox.  He also complains of abdominal pain, with one
episode of non-bloody emesis today.  Patient also endorses
feeling shortness of breath, worse in the evenings when at rest
over the past three days.  He denies any chest pain.  There was
some concern of assymetric swelling of right calf but this has
since improved per girlfriend.  Otherwise he denies changes in
vision, weakness.

He went to OSH and VS were Tm 103.3, HR 143, BP 126/86, 93% on
RA.  His ECG showed sinus tachycardia, an echocardiogram showed
mitral valve vegetation and MR (no report), and CT
chest/abd/pelvis showed splenic, renal and hepatic infarction.
An RLE US was done, no official report, but reportedly negative
for DVT.  Patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn, and also
got toradol, zofran and 2mg ativan.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further work up.

At [**Hospital1 18**], patient arrived in ED with VS: 98.4 108/72 104 20s 80s
on RA.  He improved on a NRB to the mid 90s.  Exam notable for a
murmur.  Labs notable for WBC 40s, 89% polys, neg serum
alcohol/benzos, lactate 1.6, ABG: 7.45/38/128/27. He received
one dose of gentamicin.  A head CT was done and prelim showed:
with 8mm hypodense area in right frontal periventricular region.


While on the floor, patient complained of shortness of breath,
restlessness, and abdominal pain.  He denied chest pain, fevers
since the AM.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75772**] is a 43 year old male with hx of HCV and
[**Known lastname 7344**] abuse who presented with fevers, malaise x 5 days,
transferred from OSH and found to have mitral valve vegetation
and evidence of septic emboli concerning for infective
endocarditis.

# Endocarditis:
The patient was admitted with complaints of fatigue, malaise,
abd pain, sob, and fever for past week. He had been actively
using IV drugs (shooting crushed oxycontin and cocaine) prior to
admission and drinking 2 liters of EtOH daily. CT abd showed
septic embolic and TTE; subsequent TEE showed mitral valve
vegetation and leukocytosis.  He was started on vancomycin and
zosyn at OSH; here, he was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone
with gentamicin for synergy.  On presentation, CT did show
evidence of septic emboli to the abdomen and brain. Blood
cultures at OSH were positive for Strep salivarius; blood
cultures here on [**9-18**] were positive for staph epi, thought to be
a contaminant. His course was complicated by finding of large
intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage on MRI attributed to his
endocarditis. He was started on LeVETiracetam 1000 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]
for seizure prophylaxis. Picc line was placed for long term IV
antibiotic administration.  Gentamicin was administered for
total of 14 days.  Vancomycin (day #1 [**9-12**]) should continue for
a total of 6 weeks, last dose on [**2111-10-24**].  Patient has followup
set up with Infectious Disease team after discharge.

Patient will require outpatient evaluation by Cardiothoracic
Surgery to evaluate for mitral valve repair after finishing his
course of antibiotics.  He should follow up in Cardiology clinic
after the CT Surgery evaluation.

# Cerebral hemorrhage:
On presentation, neurological exam was normal, though head CT
showed 8 mm right frontal white matter hypodensity, nonspecific,
and
without mass effect.  Follow up study using head MRI showed
large brain hemorrhage in region of R PCA territory with a L
parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Neurosurgery and neurology
were consulted and pt was started on Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis. Follow up studies suggested midline shift in the
evolving R PCA lesion and he was started on mannitol briefly.
Patient was followed with serial neuro exams on the ventilator
however after extubation he continued to be unable to move right
side of body.  Has been informed of this, but patient unable to
remember or process this information completely at this time. He
was kept on fall precautions and low boy bed. Cerebral angiogram
on Monday [**9-22**] showed mycotic aneurysm in the left middle
cerebral artery; the aneurysm was embolized with some sacrifice
of a small distal branch of the left MCA. Patient had some mild
cerebral edema post procedure and was monitored for two nights
in the Neuro ICU, then transferred to the floor. On the floor,
he showed some mild improvement in being able to just slightly
move his right hand and foot.  Of note, patient does appear to
show some signs of frontal lobe dysfunction, including
impulsivity. Patient was seen by physical and occupational
therapy.  He will require extensive post-stroke physical therapy
to attempt to regain as much function as possible of his right
upper and lower extremities.

Patient will need CT-A of head and follow up with Neurosurgery
team in 1 month as outpatient, already scheduled.

# Respiratory Status:
He was intubated for respiratory distress likely [**2-24**] to alcohol
withdrawal. He was extubated [**9-18**] w/o complication and kept on
oxygen via NC. Oxygen was weaned as tolerated.

# Alcohol Withdrawal:
Patient describes very difficult prior detox attempts. He
admitted to drinking >2 liters of alcohol during his recent
substance abuse binges. Intubated in CCU for respiratory
distress. Valium per CIWA scale was unable to alleviate his
diaphoresis, anxiety, and tachypnea. He was started on thiamine
and MVI and midazolam sedation while intubated. Post-extubation
he was continued on lorazepam 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA>10 for a
few days.  CIWA scale was discontinued upon transfer to floor,
as patient no longer showed any signs of withdrawal.

# Abdominal pain:
Pt complained of abdominal pain early during hospitalization,
likely secondary to septic emboli to kidney, liver, and spleen.
Abdominal pain self-resolved. Patient was treated for
endocarditis to prevent further septic emboli.

# [**Month/Year (2) **] abuse:
Patient has recent history of IV drug abuse with injection of
cocaine and oxycontin. Social work was consulted to follow along
with patient. Withdrawal symptoms managed as stated above.
Patient was kept on nicotine patch.

#  Hepatitis C:
Patient was diagnosed with HCV 6 years ago, unclear if he had
started any treatment. ALT, AST, and total bili were not
elevated with normal INR. No stigmata of chronic liver disease
were noted on exam. Recommend follow up with hepatologist as
outpatient.
.
#  Agitation:
Pt had several episodes of agitation and delerium at night time.
Pt was otherwise calm during the day. Agitation was felt to
likely be a sundowning effect or possible residual withdrawal
symptoms. On several occasions pt attempted to stand up and walk
which resulted in him falling out of bed given his limited
mobility. Pt did not injure himself or hit his head but there
was concern regarding his agitation leading to possible injury.
Veil bed and low bed were tried; veil bed made the pt more
agitated and angry while the low bed did not fully keep pt
within the bed but prevented falls from any height. Zyprexa was
tried as an alternative but there was some concern about whether
this contributed to further agitation on one occasion. Pt was
given low dose of ativan in the evenings with good effect,
allowing him to sleep through all or most of the night without
incident.

#Discharge:
Pt was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] in stable condition for
further rehabilitation care during his recover and completion of
IV antibiotics.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 75772**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted
to the hospital with symptoms of fever, abdominal pain,
shortness of breath and low energy. You were found to have an
infection in your heart on your mitral valve called endocarditis
likely secondary to your IV drug use. You were started on IV
antibiotics to treat this infection.

While you were hospitalized, your breathing became more labored
and you had difficulty protecting your airway in the setting of
withdrawal from the recent drugs and alcohol you had been using.
You were intubated and kept on a ventilator to help you breath.
You were extubated after a few days on the ventilator without
complication.

You also had a stroke that was attributed to your heart
infection. It was a bleed detected which is the reason for your
right sided arm and leg weakness. You were transferred to the
general floor after being stabilized in the ICU. You were
continued on IV antibiotics for the infection. Neurology
followed your case in the hospital to make recommendations
regarding your stroke.  You were also seen by the Neurosurgery
team who embolized the aneurysm they found in the left side of
your brain so that it would not bleed again.

The following changes have been made to your medications:

1. Started Ceftriaxone to treat the infection in your heart
valve
2. Take folic acid, thaimine and a multivitamin to treat
nutritional deficiencies.
3. Take nicotine patch to treat your nicotine addiction.
4. Take Levetiracetam to prevent a seizure after your stroke.
5. Take cortisone or Sarna lotion as needed for your rash
6. Take colace and senna if you get constipated
7. Take Tylenol for pain
8. Take Ativan 1-2mg at midnight to help you sleep or for
anxiety
9. Take Heparin injections to prevent more blood clots
10. Stop taking Ibuprofen

Please follow up with your doctors at the [**Name5 (PTitle) 4314**] below.

It is important that you follow up with the Neurosurgery team
and get a repeat CT-Angiogram of your head in 1 month.

You will also follow up with the infectious disease doctors.

After finishing all of your antibiotics, you will need to see
the Cardiothoracic Surgeons in clinic so that they can decide
whether or not you would benefit from surgery to fix your heart
valve that has been damaged from your infection.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
Mechanical fall at nursing home on [**2168-1-30**], transferred from OSH
to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopedic hemiarthroplasty of displaced left
femoral neck fracture, acute on chronic subdural hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left hemiarthroplasty
IVC filter placement
Left IJ central venous line placement
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
59 [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] nursing home resident with ESRD/HD, seizure
disorder, CVA w/ left-sided weakness, recent MRSA endocarditis
s/p 6 week course of Vancomycin, SLE, Atrial Fibrillation and
antiphospholipid syndrome on coumadin.  She was admitted on
[**2168-1-31**] (transfer from OSH, where she presented on [**2168-1-30**])
after a mechanical fall resulting in a left femoral neck
fracture and acute on chronic SDH in setting of INR 3.4.  She is
s/p left hemiarthroplasty on [**2168-2-1**], which was uncomplicated.
Geriatrics is following the patient and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will be
attending upon transfer.
.
Overnight from [**2-1**] --> [**2-2**], she had two witnessed tonic-clonic
seizures that both self-resolved after 1-3 minutes (note is made
in the neurology consult note that she missed her home
lamotrigine that morning).  After these seizures, she was
transferred to the SICU for further monitoring.  Neurology
following the patient was concerned for lupus cerebritis; they
requested a hypercoagulability workup, as well as a TTE given
recent endocarditis.  She has had continuous EEG to evaluate for
non-convulsive status epilepticus given her lethargy and recent
seizures.  She is currently on keppra and lamotrigine.
.
Patient was also found to have a right upper extremity DVT and
is s/p IVC filter placement on [**2168-2-1**]. As her platelets
continued to decrease, patient was found to be HIT antibody
positive.

Imaging:
[**1-31**] Left Tib/Fib Xray: No acute fracture to the tibia or fibula
[**1-31**] Bil hip Xray: Impacted transcervical fracture of the left
hip with medial rotation of the distal femur.
[**1-31**] CT head: mixed density L subdural collection consistent w/
acute on chronic hemorrhage
[**1-31**] C-spine XRay: 1. No evidence for traumatic injury involving
the cervical spine. Significant degenerative change is noted,
most severe from C4 through C7; Right thyroid nodule
1/3 L-spine: Mildly limited study of the lumbar spine with no
compression fractures identified.
.
ECHO: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Thickened
mitral valve, but no discrete vegetation seen. At least moderate
mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-11-9**],
mitral valve morphology is similar, but severity of
regurgitation has increased. The other findings are similar.
.
EEG: This is an abnormal noncontinuous extended routine EEG due
to slowing and disorganization of the background and
intermittent focal
left frontotemporal theta/detla slowing. These findings suggest
a mild
to moderate diffuse encephalopathy, and with a potentially
epileptogenic
focal structual lesion in the left frontotemporal region. No
electrographic seizures were seen during this recording.
[**2-1**] Heac Ct : Stable

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yoF with multiple medical problems including SLE, ESRD/HD,
recent endocarditis, problems with left AV fistula, seizure
disorder, CVA with left sided weakness, AFib, hypercoagulopathy
who p/w falls resulting in left hip fracture and acute on
chronic SDH. Patient is s/p left hip hemiarthoplasty and IVC
filter placement. During this hospitalization, had two seizures
overnight on POD#1, was transferred to the ICU and also found to
have HIT+ antibody.
.
#. HYPERCOAGULABLE STATE vs. BLEEDING RISK: Very complicated
risk-benefit analysis in terms of restarting anticogaulation in
patient. She has been on long-term anticoagulation with Coumadin
which had to be reversed in the setting of her acute on chronic
subdural hematoma and left hip fracture. Reasons to start
anticoagulation: HIT +, new right basilic vein DVT, AFib, recent
endocarditis, antiphospholipid syndrome in setting of SLE,
multiple CVAs with therapeutic INR, recent ortho trauma with
relative immobilization.  [**Name2 (NI) 73367**] to not anticoagulate: s/p
acute on chronic SDH after a fall on [**2167-1-31**], IVC filter.
Neurosurgery preferred that patient not be anticoagulated but
felt that if absolutely necessary, patient should be
anticoagulated with a lower PTT goal of 40-60. In the setting of
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, Hematology recommended
anticoagulation with Argatroban. The Primary Geriatric team and
patient's primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] also favored
anticoagulation. Patient was started on Argatroban gtt and was
intially supratherapeutic in the high 60s-70s. Ultimately,
patient's PTT was therapeutic at ~60 mcg/kg/minute. Patient had
neurological checks every 4 hours without concerns for rebleed
into her SDH in setting of resumed anticoagulation. Hematology
contact[**Name (NI) **] patient's previous rheumatologist at [**Hospital1 **] who confirmed patient has antiphospholipid,
anticardiolipin antibodies since [**2147**], lupus anticoagulant in
[**2152**]. Of note, Neurology had wished to start antiplatelet
therapy on patient, as well, given her coagulopathies but given
patient's low platelet counts during this admission and the fact
that she was not on Coumadin during this admission, they held
off. This will need to be discussed at her outpatient Neurology
appointment.
- Continue Argatroban gtt at rate of 0.171 mcg/kg/min given PTT
of 45.1 (decreasing) on day of discharge. Patient will get PTT
checks at hemodialysis three times weekly. Please titrate
Argatroban infusion rate accordingly, for goal PTT of 40-60.
When changing rate, should increase/decrease by
0.125-0.25mcg/kg/min.
- Start Coumadin once platelets >100 with 5 days of overlap with
Argatroban
- Please have patient follow-up in [**Hospital 878**] Clinic with Drs.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 73368**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**]. She has an appointment for
Thursday, [**2-25**] at 10:30am.

# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Patient was noted to have dropping platelet
counts and was diagnosed with HIT antibody positive serology on
[**2168-2-3**]. Hematology contact[**Name (NI) **] patient's outpatient
nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15172**], who confirmed patient has known HIT
antibody positive history. She had initially been diagnosed at
[**Hospital 794**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 789**], RI and had been evaluated by
hematology there. Once care was transferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15172**],
patient has been receiving altepase instead of heparin during
outpatient hemodialysis sessions. Hematology reviewed patient's
peripheral smear and felt that microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
is unlikely. They felt that the recent decline in platelet count
could be attributed to appropriate consumption, given recent
hemorrhage and clotting. Drug effect was also considered
although which medication causing it could not be pin-pointed.
Keppra has not been known to cause thrombocytopenia, nor
Argatroban. Lamictal is reported to cause thrombocytopenia but
patient has been on that medication long-term. Hematology
recommended platelet goal >50 with plans to start Prednisone
1mg/kg daily for ?autoimmune thrombocytopenia (in association
with APLAS) should platelet count continue to drop. Patient's
platelet count was relatively stable at 65 on day of discharge
- Continue to avoid heparin in patient; altepase can be used as
an alternative for flushes
- Please resume Coumadin once patient's platelet count is above
100. She will need 5 days overlap of Coumadin with Argatroban
- Please follow-up in [**Hospital **] Clinic. You have an appointment
to see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3065**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4762**] on [**2-19**] at 10:30am. You can
reach his office at: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 22**]
.
#. SEIZURE DISORDER: Has prior seizure disorder and acute on
chronic subdural hematoma. Neurology monitored patient for 24
hours with EEG and she was not having status epilepticus.
Immediately after her two seizures, patient was noted to have
altered mental status which gradually resolved. By day of
discharge, patient was alert and oriented X3.
- Continue Lamictal 50mg twice daily with uptitration as
follows:
Week [**1-30**] 50mg  [**Hospital1 **]
Week [**3-31**] 50/75mg
Week [**6-2**] 75mg [**Hospital1 **]
Week [**8-4**] 75/100mg
Week [**10-7**] 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
Week [**12-9**] 100/125mg
Week 13-14 125mg [**Hospital1 **]
- Continue Keppra 750mg daily, dosed AFTER hemodialysis on HD
days
- Please have patient follow-up in [**Hospital 878**] Clinic with Drs.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 73368**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**]. She has an appointment for
Thursday, [**2-25**] at 10:30am.
Location: [**Location (un) **], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Bldg [**Location (un) 858**], [**Location (un) 86**], MA
Phone number: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1694**]
.
#. s/p LEFT HEMIARTHROPLASTY: Patient was briefly on Cefazolin
post-operatively. She continued to work with physical therapy
and pain was controlled with tylenol 1 gram every 8 hours
standing
- Continue to have patient work with physical therapy (weight
bearing as tolerated)
- Continue pain control with Tylenol 1 gram every 8 hours
standing --> can decrease and make PRN as needed
- Patient needs to follow-up in the [**Hospital **] Clinic within 2
weeks. Please have her call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**] to set up a
""Post-Operative Appointment"" with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the Nurse
Practitioner.
.
#. s/p ACUTE ON CHRONIC SDH: Stable. Neurosurgery felt no
surgical intervention was needed. Of note, patient did sustain
another unwitnessed fall the day prior to discharge. CT head was
negative for any new hemorrhage and the old acute on chronic
subdural hematoma was stable. Patient demonstrated no acute
mental status changes concerning for worsening of her subdural
hematoma.
- Patient will need follow-up head CT once anticoagulation is
therapeutic
- Patient will need head CT if mental status changes (for
possible bleeding into subdural hematoma)
.
#. HYPERTENSION: It was difficult to obtain consistent blood
pressure measurements on patient given her left AV fistula and
difficulties measuring in right arm. Per neurosurgery, goal was
for patient's mean arterial pressures to be <110 to manage her
subdural hematoma and subsequent bleeding risk. Patient was
continued on home nifedipine 30mg daily and home metoprolol; the
latter was increased from 75mg to 125mg twice daily to maintain
MAP <110.
- Continue Metoprolol 125mg twice daily
- DISCONTINUE Nifedipine 30mg daily
- START Lisinopril 5mg daily
.
#. RECENT ENDOCARDITIS: Patient completed 6 week course of
Vancomycin in mid-[**Month (only) **] for MRSA endocarditis. Repeat ECHO
(TTE) during this admission confirmed residual thickening and
fibrous quality to mitral valve that can make patient at
increased risk for future embolic events.
.
#. NONFUNCTIONAL LEFT AV FISTULA: See Letter to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by
Transplant Surgery (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]) from [**2168-1-3**] in OMR.
Patient's left AV fistula is non-salvageable and patient prefers
not to have AV fistula placed in right arm. Plan was for leg
graft to be placed.
- Please have patient follow-up in Transplant Surgery with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] regarding left arm AV fistula, which is no longer
working. She can discuss plans for the leg graft. She has an
appointment for Thursday, [**2-18**] at 8:00am.
Location: [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 439**], [**Hospital Ward Name **] Bldg [**Location (un) **], [**Location (un) 86**], MA
Phone number: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3618**]
.
#. ESRD/HD: Likely secondary to lupus and/or hypertension.
Patient has some residual urine output
- Continue routine hemodialysis schedule,
Monday/Wednesday/Friday
- Continue neprhocaps and sevelamer
.
#. ANEMIA: Unclear baseline but stable during this
hospitalization
- Consider Epo at outpatient dialysis
.
#. THYROID NODULE: Incidentally noted on admission CT spine.
- Patient will need outpatient follow-up with her primary care
provider
.
#. NUTRITION: Speech and Swallow evaluated patient and felt she
was appropriate for diet as follows - PO diet of soft solids,
pills crushed in applesauce, one-on-one supervision, every 4
hours oral care.
.
#. ACCESS: Patient has right IJ placed [**2167-2-3**]; right tunneled HD
cath. Patient's left IJ entral venous line stopped drawing back
blood and could not be flushed. Patient has left AV graft and
right upper extremity DVT, making PICC lines in either arm
impossible. Left subclavian and repeat left IJ were ultimately
not attempted given significant ecchymosis in that region. Labs
can be drawn from patient's right tunneled HD catheter. Nothing
can be drawn back from the right IJ line.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70072**] is a 71 yo male who with a PMH of hypertension and
MI, who presents with back pain of 2 weeks duration.  He states
that he first noticed that something was wrong a couple of weeks
ago, after eating eating ice cream and drinking ice water at
night.  Later that night, after going to bed and falling asleep,
he was woken with a strange feeling which he describes as a
curtain descending down over his abdomen.  He states it felt as
if his body, in the region of his abdomen, had just shut down.
He fell back asleep the night, hoping that the strange feeling
would go away on its own.  Over the next few days, he began to
notice a pain in his upper back.  He describes that pain as
similar to a muscle spasm, in his back, that does not radiate.
When the pain first began, it was intermittent and could be
brought on by nearly anything, including getting up to walk and
eating.  He tried Advil and acetominophen which helped at first
to relieve his pain.  He noticed that his pain gradually became
more intense, and more intolerable.  He reports occasional chest
pain, shortness of breath, and feeling feverish when his pain
would become severe. At the time of presentation to an OSH, his
pain was constant, not relieved with Advil or acetominophen, and
he reports it as a [**9-26**].  He also developed a dry,
non-productive cough over the past 2-3 days, and a feeling of
nausea that developed when he would cough.  At times, when the
pain would become severe, he began to feel feverish and
developed sweats.  He reports that his last bowel movement was
nearly a week ago.  Patient reports that he was in Tripoli,
North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s during the Korean war.  Recalls one
episode of walking pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not
hospitalized.  Recalls no episodes of hemoptysis.  He estimates
that he has lost ~10 pounds over the past two months due to
decreased appetite and pain with eating.  He denies chills,
night sweats, changes in vision, headache, shortness of breath,
chest pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, numbness,
parasthesias.

Pertinent Results:
MRI C/T/L spine [**2100-11-29**]:
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM:
There is no evidence of disc infection.  There is degenerative
disc disease at multiple levels.
At C4-C5, there is a small central disc protrusion without
evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis.
At C5-C6, there is a broad-based disc-osteophyte bar producing
moderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.
At C6-C7, there is mild retrolisthesis producing moderate canal
and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.  There is no evidence
of abnormal cord signal or abnormal cord enhancement.
IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative disease as described.
.
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM:
IMPRESSION:  Paraspinal mass with vertebral body involvement at
T7-T8.  There is involvement of the disc, and there is an
epidural mass.  The features in general suggest that this may be
a malignant process rather than an active infection, although
granulomatous disease would be an additional consideration.  The
findings are a bit unusual for bacterial abscess, but this is
not entirely excluded.
.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE:
IMPRESSION:  First degree spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.  Mild disc
bulging.  No evidence of focal disc protrusion.  No evidence of
a destructive mass or abscess in the lumbar region.
.
CT T-spine w/o contrast [**2100-11-30**]:
Again seen is destruction of the inferior one-half of T7 and
superior endplate of T8 with a large associated paraspinal mass.
 There is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion of
bone fragments into the
ventral part of the spinal canal.  The degree of cord
compression is better evaluated on the previous day's MRI.
Again noted is kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at this
locale.  No new abnormalities are identified. There are
emphysematous changes in the lungs.  Aortic calcifications are
identified.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2100-12-2**]:
CT ABDOMEN:  The gallbladder is distended likely due to fasting.
 However,
clinical correlation is recommended.  The liver, spleen, and
pancreas are
unremarkable.  The small 11-mm left adrenal gland nodule is not
well
characterized in this study.  The right adrenal gland is normal.
 Small
hypodense area at the interpolar region of the right kidney is
too small to be characterized.  Small and large bowel are
grossly unremarkable.  There is a moderate amount of stool
within the colon.  The appendix is within normal limits.  Severe
calcifications of the aorta.  All the major branches are patent.
 No free fluid or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS:  Urinary bladder, distal ureters are unremarkable.
No free fluid or free air in the pelvis.  Calcifications within
the prostate. Small segment of chronic dissection involving both
proximal common ilia
arteries.
.
TTE [**2100-12-6**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. LVEF=55%.  The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with focal near akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral
wall. The remaining segments contract well. Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular cavity size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No systolic prolapse is seen. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR PA/Lateral [**2100-12-6**]:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions but no evidence for CHF. Small well defined nodular
density right lung base. Correlate with prior outside films if
available . Further evaluation, either by follow up plain
radiographs in approx 3 months or by CT is suggested.
.
Chest CT [**2100-12-7**]:
The multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are subcentimeter ranging
up to 9 mm in the right paratracheal, 8 mm in the outer
pulmonary, and 1 cm in subcarinal are.  There is no hilar or
axillary lymphadenopathy.  The aorta is calcified with
relatively thick mural plaques ranging up to 4 mm, some of them
ulcerated, for example in the proximal distending thoracic
aorta, series 2, image 26, 27; at the level of the aortic arch,
series 2, image 21; in the distending aorta, series 2, image 31.
 The extensive mural thickening also involve the origin of the
left subclavian and left carotid and innominate arteries.
The assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrate mild
centrilobular emphysema involving predominantly the upper lobes.
 A focal thickening of the left fissure is 4.3 mm in length.
The bilateral pleural effusion is small with adjacent lung
atelectasis.  Additional area of focal pleural thickening is in
the right upper lobe, series 4, image 45.  No other lung nodules
or masses are identified.  The images of the upper abdomen
demonstrate normal liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas and
kidneys.  The gallbladder is markedly distended measuring up to
6 cm in diameter with some high-attenuation of the posterior
portion suggesting vicarious excretion.
.
[**2100-12-17**] U/S:  IMPRESSION: Negative bilateral lower extremity DVT
study.
.
[**2100-12-27**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Increase in size of left pleural
effusion and new relatively large area of consolidation in
lingula and left lower lobe since prior study of [**2100-12-24**].

.
[**2100-12-30**] CT CHEST:  IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in size of a moderate left pleural effusion with
loculated components. High attenuation within a loculated fluid
collection in the left upper hemithorax suggests component of
possible hemothorax and is unchanged. No evidence of new or
active extravasation.
2. Ground-glass opacity at the left base consistent with
reexpansion edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis.
Bibasilar hydrostatic interstitial edema.
3. Stable appearance of postoperative change within the mid
thoracic spine as above.
4. Tiny left hydropneumothorax, likely secondary to recent
thoracentesis

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 71 yo male with history of coccygeal
fracture, and CAD, who presented with back pain of 2 weeks
duration, found to have a T7-T8 epidural mass on MRI. He
subsequently was found to have a MSSA osteomyelolitis, underwent
colpectomy and fusion, however his course was complicated by
post-op NSTEMI, bradycardic arrest (complete heart block), upper
extremity venous clot, and delerium.
.
## Epidural Mass:
Patient presented with back pain of increasing severity of 2
weeks duration, that he rated as [**9-26**] on admission. Patient had
decreased patellar reflexes but no other focal neurological
deficits, and back was non-tender to palpation. No leg weakness,
sensory deficits or bowel/bladder incontinence.  MRI on
admission showed an epidural mass at T7-T8 level with some
moderate cord compression.  CT spine confirmed this finding.
Found to have elevated ESR to 102 and CRP of 216 concerning for
infectious process. Based on imaging the differential of the
epidural mass was infection (bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma),
vs malignancy vs AV malformation. The patient denied any history
or exposure to TB, however he was in North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s
during the Korean war. Recalled one episode of walking
pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not hospitalized. Recalls no
episodes of hemoptysis. The patient denied any history of
malignancy, however he has not seen a physician in many years.
Given the possibility of infection he was started on
broad-spectrum abx including Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and flagyl
IV.  He was afebrile.  Ortho spine followed the patient and he
was provided with a TLSO brace given his T7 collapse.  Serial
neurological exams were performed looking for signs of cord
compression and were normal.  On [**12-3**] the patient underwent
CT-guided biopsy of the mass and tissue was sent to microbiology
 and pathology.  Gram stain and culture returned positive for
GPC.  ID was consulted for further recommendations.  When
organisms were identified as Staph aureus the ceftriaxone and
flagyl were discontinued.  He was continued on vancomycin with
goal troughs 17-20.  When sensitivities returned MSSA the
vancomycin was switched to Nafcillin 2gm IV q4h.
.
ID recommended TTE given epidural abscess and murmur on exam
(unclear age given no regular medical care).  TTE showed no
evidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses.  A
TEE was not performed given the patient would require a long
course of antibiotics and TEE would not change the management.
A PPD was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differential
and was negative.  Additionally, AFB smear and stain were both
negative.  AFB culture is pending.  There was no evidence of
granulomas on CXR or chest CT suggestive of old TB infection.
.
Although the patient appeared to have an MSSA abscess, an
underlying process could not be excluded.  Given possibility for
underlying malignancy an SPEP/UPEP were sent. PSA was 1.0 and
chest CT showed no lung nodules. Path of epidural biopsy showed
inflammation. Given the location of the abscess and involvement
of T7-T8 vertebrae with T7 collapse, the patient was taken to
the OR for surgical spine debridement/stabilization by ortho
spine. He underwent two surgical procedures to debride and
stabilize his spine (please see op notes from [**12-10**] and [**12-13**]
for details).  He should complete a 6 week course of nafcillin
to end on [**2101-1-20**].  He has follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**2101-1-5**] and may need lifelong suppressive therapy.
.
## NTEMI - Two days after his second surgery, the patient
developed chest pain.  An EKG revealed lateral ST depressions.
The pain was relieved by nitroglycerine complicated by mild
hypotension.  His cardiac enzymes were positive with a troponin
T peak of 0.27. His CPK-MB was also mildly elevated to 12.  He
was conservatively managed particularly with regard to his
recent spine surgery.  His cardiac regimen was adjusted to
include aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and Imdur.
.
## Cardiac arrest - The patient's course was further complicated
by a bradycardic arrest leading to asystole.  This episode was
not captured on telemetry. He received CPR as his DNR status had
temporarily been changed peri-operative.  He was resuscitated
successfully without use of epinephrine, atropine, or
electricity.  He was initially stabilized after transfer to the
CCU but had a similar arrest twice the next morning each
following repositioning. Telemetry revealed complete heartblock.
 An externalized pacemaker was placed with a screw-in lead in
the RV as putting a permanent pacer in while the osteomyelitis
was being treated.  The bradycardia appears to have been
triggered by excessive vagal tone.  The day before discharge a
perm. pacemaker was placed and was interrogated by EP and found
to be working well.  He has follow up on [**2101-1-5**] with the
device clinic to further evaluate the pacer.
.
## Anemia: Patient was found to be anemic on admission.  No
baseline for comparison.  Fe studies suggestive of anemia of
chronic disease.  Patient reports no hemoptysis,
hematemesis,melena, or hematochezia. EBL from the surgery was
~500cc.  Late into his CCU stay, he developed guaiac positive
stool.  His Hct stabilized after transfusion.  He continued on a
PPI.  He can follow-up with his PCP for potential referral to GI
for colonoscopy as an outpatient.
.
## Delirium: The patient developed delirium attributed to
medications (narcotics and benzodiazepines), and disruption in
sleep-wake cycle and CCU psychosis.  He was found not to have
capacity to refuse life saving interventions.  His daughter
[**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was appointed health care proxy.  The patient's
agitation was managed with nightly haldol with as needed haldol
as well.  Other sedating medications such as narcotics and
benzodiazepines should be avoided as much as possible. Once he
was transferred to the regular medical floor his delirium
improved and by discharge he no longer displayed any signs of
delirium.
.
## Constipation/diarrhea:  Patient had not had a bowel movement
in over a week when he presented.  He was started on an
aggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement of
large amount of narcotics.  This bowel regimen was weaned down
over the course of his hospital stay.  Since being on the
antibiotics, he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube in
place. The diarrhea could be from an infectious source vs. the
antibiotics themselves.  He was tested for C diff and found to
be negative x3.  A C diff B toxin has been sent and will be
followed up after discharge.
.
## Hypertension:  Patient has a history of hypertension but had
never been treated. BP was initially labile and elevated
readings seemed to correlate with pain.  When pain was better
controlled the patient's BP remained elevated with SBP 140-150
at times.  His blood pressure was controlled as above.
.
## Iliac artery dissections: Incidental finding on CT. Vascular
consult obtained. No evidence of peripheral vascular compromise.
 Vascular team recommended outpatient follow up in 6 months with
ultrasound.
.
## Upper Extremitiy DVT - The patient developed a clot in the
right cephalic vein in the setting of a RIJ central venous
catheter.  He was initially anticoagulated but this was held in
the setting of the GIB.  Warm compresses and arm elevation
should be used to limit propagation of the clot.  The patient
had a CTA of the chest that was negative for PE.
.
## Enterobacter in sputum - The patient did have a sputum
culture that revealed a pan-sensitive enterobacter cloacae.  He
did not have any clinical evidence of pneumonia (no fever,
normalizing WBC, no definitive consolidation on imaging).
Antibiotics, levofloxicin, directed at this bacteria were
started when he was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR and some
shortness of breath. He also developed a large pleural effusion
and underwent a thorocentesis.  The fluid was exudative and
likely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain was
negative (he has been on antibiotics).  The cytology is still
pending and should be followed up by his PCP.
.
## Elevated Creatinine - Creatinine was 1.6 on admission.
corrected following IVF.
.
## Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin converted to [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings and
pneumo-boots with slow GIB.
.
## FEN -Regular diet with 5x/day nutritional supplements with
ensure plus. Did have hypokalemia likely secondary to
medications and loose stools.  He will receive standing
potassium repletion and need potassium level checked shortly
after discharge to adjust the dose.
.
## CODE - DNR/DNI. patient's daughter [**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was
appointed health care proxy during this admission.
.
## Dispo - discharged to rehab

Discharge Instructions:
You have been evaluated and treated for an infection in your
vertebral column.  You underwent 2 surgeries to remove as much
of the infection as possible and to stabilize the spine.
However, after the surgeries you had a small heart attack.  Your
course was further complicated by a very slow heart rate that
required a pacemaker to keep you rate fast enough.
.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
.
You will need to continue the nafcillin until [**2100-1-20**].  You
should follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2101-1-5**] as below to
determine if lifelong antibiotics will be needed.
.
You will need to schedule an appointment with ortho spine Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] (number written below) in mid [**Month (only) **]. You must wear your
TLSO brace for 3months whenever you want to get out of bed and
walk around or sit in a chair. This helps to stablize your back
and is very important to keep from damaging you back.
.
Your new pacemaker is working well. You must keep your
appointment on Wed [**1-5**] at 10am to have it further evaluated.
With your new pacemaker, you must not raise your arm above your
head for 6 weeks.
.
You had some blood in your stool.  You will need an outpatient
colonoscopy in the future.

Pertinent Results:
[**2127-2-6**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
1. No fracture or acute malalignment is detected. Collection
around odontoid process with encroachment of ventral cord is
suggestive of hematoma in setting of trauma. MR of cervical
spine is recommended.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine as described.

[**2127-2-6**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. Acute left hemisphere subdural hematoma which is most
pronounced adjacent to the left occipital lobe . 5mm shift of
normal midline structure is visualized.
2. No fracture detected.

[**2127-2-7**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. Large, but stable, left subdural hematoma with mild mass
effect.

[**2127-2-8**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. Unchanged appearance of large left parieto-occipital subdural
hematoma, and mild mass effect.

[**2127-2-10**] ECHO - Moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal left ventricular
systolic function. The right ventricle is not well seen but may
well be dilated and hypokinetic. There is asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy without evidence of outflow tract
gradient.

[**2127-2-13**] CXR - New bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration
giving its relatively rapid appearance.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with dementia, AFib, HTN admitted with
SDH s/p fall.

NEURO: Mr. [**Known lastname 76261**] was admitted to the ICU on [**2127-2-6**] with a left
parietal/occipital SDH. He did well neurologically while he was
in the ICU. The patient does have baseline dementia, but was
moving all 4 extremities and was partially oriented. He had a CT
scan on [**2127-2-8**] which showed that the SDH was stable and he was
transferred to the neuro step-down unit that day. He was placed
on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis for a total of 10 days (last
day [**2127-2-16**]).  The patient continued to do well neurologically
and was transferred to the floor on [**2127-2-9**]. The ortho-spine
team recommended that the patient wear a soft collar and he will
follow-up with them in 2 weeks with dynamic C-spine xrays.  The
patient was neurosurgically stable and did not need any surgical
intervention and it was decided that the patient should be
transferred to the geriatrics service for further care.   Prior
to his acute decompensation, he was instructed to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  His respiratory status then worsened, prompting his
family to seek comfort measures only.  He expired [**2127-2-16**].

RESP: On [**2127-2-10**] the patient had a video swallow evaluation,
showing that he was aspirating 50% with an agreed upon resultant
plan for PEG.  Pt's mental status improved over 48hrs with a
repeat video swallow [**2127-2-13**] showing minimal aspiration and a
diet for honey thick liquids and pureed solids was recommended
with supplemental IV fluid.  The family then decided that they
would not want a PEG tube placed.  On [**2127-2-13**] the patient had an
episode of emesis and a fever of 102F.  He was found to be
tachypneic and was pan cultured and a chest xray was done.  The
chest xray showed new bibasilar opacities consistent with
aspiration.  He was started on Levaquin and Flagyl (levo to
finish on [**2-16**], flagyl to finish on [**2-18**]).  He respiratory
status improved and he was oxygenating well on RA.  He resumed
oral feeding with honey pre-thickened liquids and pureed solids
with assistance.  [**2-15**] was transferred to the MICU after he
developed sudden SOB with destaurations into the 60s and
tachycardia when being transfered from chair to bed. There was
no aspiration event noticed. The patient was confused and unable
to voice complaints. An EKG was concerning for STE in III and
aVF. Cardiology was called but did not think ACS was likely and
an intervention would be feasible in the light of SDH. The
patient was transfered to the MICU where he was started on a
NIPPV.  He was also given aspirin, metoprolol, morphine and
started on Heparin gtt with a goal of PTT 40-60 per
neurosurgery. Haldol was given for sedation. A Stat ECHO
revealed left ventricular systolic function of 30-40% secondary
to a new basal inferior and posterior hypokinesis as well as to
rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. The right
ventricular cavity was dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The patient continued to be tachypneic on the
NIPPV.  Given worsening respiratory status and obvious patient
discomfort, family meeting was held.  Given poor prognosis,
patient was made CMO and care was directed towards comfort until
he expired on [**2127-2-16**].

CARDIAC: He also complained of some right sided chest pain and
dyspnea. An EKG was unchanged from previous with no acute ST-T
changes.  Cardiac enzymes were drawn and set 1 had a CK of 710
and troponin of 0.15.  It was felt that the elevation could be
due to chronic renal insufficiency, but enzymes were cycled.
His enzymes remained stable and he was maintained on ASA.
Expired [**2127-2-16**].

HYPERNATREMIA: During this admission, he also became
progressively hypernatremic which was not responsive to changing
IV fluids to D5 1/2NS and later D5 1/4NS and given several free
water boluses per NGT.  His potassium was repleted to normal
levels.  His creatinine increased to 2.4 from baseline of 1.9.
With continued hydration with D5W his Na started to improve.
Given family wishes for comfort, aggressive free water
repleation was stopped and he expired [**2127-2-16**].

COAGULOPATHY: INR also was found to be increased during the
course of the admission.  This was thought likely to be due to
poor nutritional status.  He received a dose of vitamin K on
[**2127-2-13**].  Which did decrease his coagulopathy, was briefly
started on a heparin gtt upon transfer to the MICU given concern
for PE vs ACS.  When goals of care changed per family request,
this was discontinued as was monitoring of his PTTs.

Given worsening respiratory status, and patient & family wish to
not pursue more aggressive care including intubation, patient
was made CMO status on [**2127-2-16**] and expired soon after with his
family at his side.

RUQ U/S:
Cholelithiasis with US findings equivocal for acute
cholecystitis, and clinical correlation is recommended. In
particular, the
combination of stones, distension and wall thickening with edema
could be seen
with cholecystitis, but clinical correlation is needed since the
appearance is
not specific and the given history is of left flank pain. A
hepatobiliary
scan may be helpful if there is concern for choleystitis and
possibly serial
ultrasound scanning.

ABD/PELV CT:
1. Bilateral perinephric stranding, prominence in stranding of
the left
ureter, may reflect a recently passed left-sided stone or
sequelae of upper
urinary tract infection, clinical correlation is recommended.
Although much
more prominent on the left, fat stranding is also present about
the right
kidney, which suggests that process may be bilateral. The lack
of stones
makes recent passage of a stone less likely.

2. Distended gallbladder with trace amount of pericholecystic
fluid in the
setting of periportal edema and [**Doctor First Name 9189**] mesentery with mild soft
tissue
anasarca; part of these changes could reflect third spacing;
however, if
clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, an ultrasound should
be considered.

3. Nonobstructed ventral hernia containing loops of transverse
colon.

4. Left adnexal cystic structure, which may represent
hydrosalpinx. Further
evaluation with a pelvic ultrasound is recommended when
clinically
appropriate.



Brief Hospital Course:
43 year-old woman with a history of hypertension, obesity s/p
gastric bypass [**2170**] and chronic nutritional anemia [**1-20**] bypass
surgery presenting with pyelonephritis and urosepsis.

# Urosepsis/Pyelonephritis: Initially met SIRS criteria with
bandemia, tachycardia, and left ureteral fat stranding and UA
with evidence of infection. Received 7L of NS in ED without
improvement. Treated in ICU with pressors and IV vanc. Blood
cultures w/pan sensitive GNRs and UCx w/EColi. Switched to PO
levoflox (nausea w/ cipro IV and poor bioavaialability of PO
version).

# Acute renal failure: Resolved. Prerenal in setting of sepsis
and hypotension. Treated with IVFs.

# Microcytic anemia: Hct 23.5 vs baseline ~30. Thought to be
nutritional [**1-20**] gastric bypass, low B12, low iron, guiaics
negative.

# Headache: similar to baseline headaches, frontal headache no
visual changes no nausea. Started on ibuprofen with some initial
improvement.

# HTN: controlled on home medications.

# gallbladder edema: initially concerning for cholecystitis but
unlikely given normal LFTs and absence of LUQ pain. Surgery
consulted. No need for further treatment or evaluation at this
time.

Date of Birth:   [**2113-10-6**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old female
with diabetes mellitus times thirteen years, history of
gastrointestinal bleed, seen by outpatient cardiologist
[**2190-12-15**], for preoperative clearance for cataract surgery.
In the office, the patient complained of substernal chest
pain radiating to the left arm with nausea over the past day.
Electrocardiogram showed a 2.0 to 3.[**Street Address(2) 52938**] elevation, right-sided leads consistent with right
ventricular infarct.  Troponin 13.5.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization on
Heparin drip, Integrilin, Plavix and Aspirin.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed 100% proximal occlusion of the
distal collateral filling, status post successful Hepacoat
stents times two.  The procedure was complicated by sinus
node dysfunction exacerbated by transient no reflow.  The
patient was transferred to the CCU for control with AV pacing
wires on Dopamine.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amitriptyline.
2.  Multivitamin.
3.  Eye drops.
4.  Humulin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus times thirteen years.
2.  History of upper gastrointestinal bleed.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with husband.  [**Name (NI) 482**]
Hindi.  The patient denies alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of myocardial infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, temperature is 98.8,
heart rate 98, blood pressure 90 to 110 over 50 to 60.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat - Extraocular movements are
intact.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation. Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck
revealed no jugular venous distention.  Respiratory -
intubated.  Clear breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, II/VI
holosystolic murmur.  Extremities showed 2+ dorsalis pedis
bilaterally, warm, no edema.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram precatheterization showed
sinus at 75 beats per minute, normal axis, early R wave
progression, inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction, 2.0
to 3.0 millimeters, small Q wave, aVL less than 1.0
millimeter, ST depressions V5 and V6 with less than 1.[**Street Address(2) 52939**] elevations consistent with prior study.

Echocardiogram on [**2190-12-15**], showed symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, unusually small left ventricular cavity, mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting
regional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral
akinesis and hypokinesis.  The right ventricular cavity is
dilated.  Right ventricular systolic function was depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened, mild 1+
aortic regurgitation, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation.

Cardiac catheterization on [**2190-12-15**], showed left anterior
descending 40 to 50% of the mid posterior diagonal, left
circumflex 80% at the mid large obtuse marginal, right
coronary artery 100% proximally with distal collaterals.
Left ventriculogram showed ejection fraction of 40%, severe
right ventricular hypokinesis.

Creatinine 1.1, hematocrit 37.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronary artery disease - The patient had initial cardiac
catheterization and stents placed to the right coronary
artery as described above.  She had two right coronary artery
stents placed and at the time of catheterization had
temporary AV pacing wires placed.  She was intubated at the
time.  Her catheterization was complicated by bouts of
bradycardia and hypotension with initial balloon dilation
requiring Atropine, Dopamine and right ventricular pacing.
Coronary sinus pacing wire was placed with continuous
Dopamine drip for augmentation of blood pressure.  During her
CCU course she ultimately regained intrinsic pacing function
and her pacing wires were discontinued.  She was started on
an Aspirin, Plavix, statin, ace inhibitor and beta blocker.

Pump function - Echocardiogram as described above.
Initially, the patient had severe right ventricular
dysfunction, however, she regained much of her function in
her right ventricle and subsequent echocardiogram on
[**2190-12-27**], showed a mildly dilated left atrium, left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and systolic function
are normal with an ejection fraction of 55%.  The right
ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.  Right ventricular
systolic function depressed.  Mild 1+ aortic regurgitation,
moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation, and compared to the
findings of the prior report, the inferior wall motion
abnormality had resolved.

Rhythm - The patient temporarily required AV pacing, however,
her sinus function was regained and she has maintained a
normal sinus rhythm during her hospitalization.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was intubated in the
catheterization laboratory for agitation and initially failed
extubation secondary to increased granulation tissue around
the intubation tubing.  On [**2190-12-28**], she failed a second
extubation secondary to the airway edema.  On [**2190-12-29**], an
open tracheostomy was performed by the ENT service in the
operating room.  Since that time, she has been progressively
changed to smaller and smaller tracheostomy tubes and at the
time of this dictation, the expectation is that she will not
need a tracheostomy for long term care and that she will
regain regular upper airway pulmonary function.  However, in
the meantime, she will need rehabilitation services.

3.  Gastroenterology - The patient had a history of upper
gastrointestinal bleed and, while intubated, she was
maintained on tube feedings.  After extubation and
tracheostomy placement, the patient failed a speech and
swallow test on two separate occasions.  A percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed on [**2191-1-4**], for
feeding purposes until the time when she is able to swallow
on her own.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient had a period of time
during her hospitalization where she had fevers of unknown
etiology.  She completed a course of Vancomycin, Levaquin and
Flagyl for suspected aspiration pneumonia.  At the time of
this dictation, all cultures have not grown anything to date.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility with follow-up
with cardiology.  Her primary cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] at
[**Hospital3 1280**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Insulin sliding scale.
3.  NPH 28 units twice a day.
4.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Atrovent MDI two puffs q6hours p.r.n.

Micro data:

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  symptomatic bradycardia - Pt was likely bradycardic due to
digoxin toxicity.  Digibind was given to the patient at the
outside hospital, and there was no indication for acute
dialysis.  The precipitating factors of digoxin toxicity were
thought to be diarrhea and dehydration-induced renal failure,
causing decreased clearance of dignoxin.  Digoxin was stopped,
as was his beta blocker.  Pt's heart rate increased to 70s-80s
and he was hemodynamically stable.  His digoxin was
discontinued.  He was tried again on his beta blocker prior to
discharge, but this again resulted in bradycardia into the low
50s.

2.  acute on chronic renal failure - Pt's chronic renal failure
was thought to be due to long-standing hypertensive disease; pt
was also taking continual NSAIDs.  Renal consult was called.
Acute renal failure was thought likely to be due to ATN due to
the course of recovery and post-ATN diuresis; ATN developed most
likely in the setting of long-standing dehydration, with NSAID
use.  FENa was 1.5%.  A smear for urine eosinophils was
negative.  Pt's renal ultrasound showed somewhat enlarged
kidneys, raising the concern for multiple myeloma; SPEP and UPEP
were sent.  Of note, pt had nephrotic range proteinuria on 2
different urine samples (5.4g/day and 6.5g/day); the etiology
for this is unclear, but could be due to minimal change disease.
 Pt will follow up in nephrology clinic.  During the course of
his hospitalization, pt's renal function was in the direction of
recovery (Cr on admission 3.7, on discharge 2.8, baseline about
1.3).  Pt had good urine output during his stay and did not
require dialysis.

3.  hyperkalemia - Hyperkalemia was thought to be due primarily
to acute renal failure, but also with ACE inhibitor and
triamterene use.  These drugs were held. Pt's potassium was 7.6
on admission.  He was treated with lasix, Kayexalate, D50, and
insulin.  Pt's potassium was better controlled by HD #2 and
remained stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
This was likely due to renal failure and reolved with
improvement of renal function.

4.  diarrhea - Pt's diarrhea had resolved by HD #2.  Stool
studies were sent, which were negative for C diff, Salmonella,
and Shigella.

5.  hypertension - Pt's SBP was around 160s-170s on transfer to
the floor.  His baseline per clinic notes seemed to be around
160s.  This may be a contributing factor to his chronic kidney
disease.  Pt's ACE I was held in the setting of acute renal
failure; BB was held in the setting of symptomatic bradycardia;
diuretics were held in the setting of acute renal failure.
Therefore, pt was ultimately begun on amlodipine 10mg the day
prior to discharge, and his SBP over the course of that day
ranged from 140s-160s systolic.

6.  anemia - Pt was guaiac negative.  His Hct was 27.4 on
admission.  He received 2 units PRBC with appropriate bump in
Hct.  Iron studies revealed a slightly low TIBC (259), a normal
iron (60) and a normal ferritin (274).  Pt's Hct remained stable
through the rest of his hospitalization and was 33.7 on the day
of discharge.

7.  depression/anxiety - Pt was continued on Zoloft and
buspirone during his hospital stay.  There were no acute issues.

8.  dizziness - pt complained of a couple of episodes of
transient dizziness during the last few days of admission.
During these episodes, 12-lead EKGs were normal, he was not
orthostatic, and his glucose and other electrolytes were stable.
 He was not unstable on his feet.  He was somewhat confused at
the start of one episode, but this resolved within [**10-30**]
minutes.  Pt reports that he has had multiple episodes of this
in the past.  He may need further workup as an outpatient.

9.  history of CAD - Pt had recent cardiac catheterization.  He
was maintained on his aspirin and Plavix, as well as his statin.
 He may need to be restarted on his beta blocker at some future
date, but he likely has nodal disease, as the beta blocker
caused significant bradycardia.

10.  FEN/GI - Pt was maintained on a renal, cardiac diet.  He
was given IV fluids as needed.

History of Present Illness:
68 year-old M with H/O A fibb on Coumadin, COPD, HTN, DM2, and
extensive tobacco Hx who presented to an OSH with progressive
SOB and pleuritic chest pain X 2 days and was found to have a
large left-sided pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
He received Zosyn 4.5mg IV x 1, 2 units of FFP and vitamin k for
a supratherapuetic INR and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED his vitals were T 98.4 HR 120 BP 133/81 RR 24 O2 sat
94%. He had a leukocytosis of 34, left shift with 6 bands, and
INR of 2.5. He received additional FFP & DDAVP and was
transferred to the ICU. Interventional Pulmonology was
consulted, performed a thoracentesis, placed a pigtail drain,
which drained 1.2 L of turbid yellow fluid (procedure stopped
[**1-21**] worsening SOB and pain). The patient's respiratory status
worsened (ABG 7.28/50/96), required NRB, weaned to 60% facemask.
It was thought this could be secondary to re-expansion of a
diseased lung or pulmonary edema. He was started on Vanco and
Zosyn. His UOP dropped and he became HOTN, which resolved with
fluids. Vanc was discontinued. Patient improved and was
transferred to the floor, requiring 4L O2 on NC.
.
Currently, he reports continued shortness of breath and pain
with deep inspiration. He has had an intentional 25 lbs weight
loss over the last 2 months. He has had SOB for over a year,
which he attributed to his smoking history. It is worse on
exertion, would be huffing after one flight of stairs, denies
orthopnyea, PND, or leg swelling. He is followed by a
cardiologist and has had 2 stress tests in the past, results
unknown per patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87427**] is a 68yo M w/hx of afib on Coumadin, DM2, COPD who
presents with respiratory distress found to have a large left
sided pleural effusion.
.
#PLEURAL EFFUSION: His elevated INR was reversed with FFP,
vitamin K, ddAVP and he underwent diagnostic and therapeutic
thoracentesis with pigtail placement by interventional
pulmonology. Initial pleural fluid studies (pH 6.5, low glucose)
suggested a complicated infectious process versus malignancy.
Repeat imaging after effusion drainage did not show an obvious
mass. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and then
transition to Levaquin and completed a 2 week course.  All of
the cultures to date have no growth.

Thoracic Surgery was consulted and he underwent Left
thoracoscopy converted to left thoracotomy, decortication of
lung on [**2138-7-18**]. He was transferred to the SICU intubated and
on pressors.  He weaned off the pressors, successfully extubated
on [**2138-7-22**].  He transfer to the floor in stable condition.

Chest tubes anterior, posterior and basilar were to water-seal.
The posterior was remove on [**2138-7-22**].  The anterior on [**2138-7-23**]
and the basilar on [**2138-7-24**] once the pleural cultures were
negative.

Chest films: serial chest films were done which showed pleural
thickening on the left, elevation of the left  hemidiaphragm and
the appearance of the left basal and right lower lobe
atelectasis.

Respiratory; with aggressive pulmonary toilet, neb, chest PT,
diuresis and ambulation he titrated off oxygen with saturations
of 93%.

.
#ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: His creatinine was 3.5 on
admission with clinical history, exam, and labs (FeNa 0.3)
suggestive of pre-renal etiology. Renal ultrasound did not
demonstrate obstruction or hydronephrosis to suggest post--renal
etiology. Medications were renal dosed and nephrotoxic agents
were held. He was given intravenous fluids and his creatinine
improved.

On [**2138-7-22**] he was volume overload and given IV Lasix with good
response.  He continue on Lasix while hospitalized and
discharged on 40 mg PO.  He had 3+ lower extremity.  ACE wraps
were applied.  His cardiologist was notified and he will follow
his volume status as an outpatient.
.
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: He was continued on diltiazem for rate
control 70-80's. Digoxin was held in the setting of acute renal
failure, then restarted upon resolution. His Coumadin was held
and anticoagulation initially reversed in order for the pigtail
catheter to be placed. Thereafter he was started on a heparin
drip, which was discontinued prior to VATS.  Anticoagulation
(warfarin) was restarted on [**2138-7-21**] his home dose of 5 mg.  On
[**2138-7-24**] he was given 7.5 mg Coumadin for INR 1.4.  and [**2138-7-25**]
for INR 1.6.  He will continue on his home dose of 5 mg and
follow-up with his cardiologist on Monday.
.
#HTN: Initially his home antihypertensives were held. HCTZ was
re-started for BP control. His blood pressure 89-110 and would
not tolerate ACE at this time.
.
#DM2: His oral hyperglycemic medications were held. He was
started on an insulin sliding scale. On [**2138-7-23**] his PO
hyperglycemic meds were restarted. His blood sugars range were
150-170.
.
#DEPRESSION: He was continued on Wellbutrin.
.
#COPD: He was continued on symbicort and spiriva.

Disposition: He was followed by physical therapy.  His
ambulation improved.  He was discharged to home with his family
and VNA.  He will follow-up with his cardiologist on Monday for
warfarin management and volume status.  He will follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks for Chest CT with contrast.

Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH with fevers, back pain, and pathologic
evidence of Sweet Syndrome


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Bone marrow biopsy
Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
(Primary historians: wife & daughter):
66 y/o male with lung cancer s/p RUL lobectomy, back pain w/
spondylolisthesis, s/p lumbar laminectomes x2, initially
admitted to OSH with back pain, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with
fevers, leukocytosis, and delirium.
.
Patient was in his usual state of health until mid-[**8-11**]-2 weeks after returning to [**State 350**] from [**State 8842**]. He
initially complained of acute onset R lower back pain that
started after leaning over quickly.  He went to see his
chiropractor.  Pain worsened and developed L sided back pain as
well.  Also with + constipation and LE weakness.  Around this
same time, the patient started developing a productive cough and
fevers.
.
He presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**9-2**].  Initially alert and
oriented x 3, but noted to ""say odd things"".  He was febrile to
101 in the ED, and was intermittently confused.  MRI back showed
L5-S1 central disc protrusion without mass effect or abnormal
enhancement.  CT of the head showed diffuse mild cerebral
atrophy with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. MRI with
and without contrast showed no evidence for meningitis and no
enhancing mass lesion. Neurosurgery was consulted and felt no
intervention needed based on lumbar imaging.  ID consulted, and
felt the patient had no clear signs of infection, aside from
fevers, so antibiotics have been generally held.  Neurology
assessment was to assess the patient for viral illness,
including viral meningitis, less likely paraneoplastic disorder.
Lumbar puncture was attempted x 4, with records indicating that
one attempt may have yielded venous blood.  Acyclovir was
temporarily started and then d/c'd when LP fluid was negative
for HSV PCR. Heme/onc consulted for leukocytosis, bone marrow
aspirate revealed myelodysplasia with no evidence of leukemia.
Chromosomal and cytogenetic studies were sent.
.
Required ICU stay for angioedema of tongue with rash of neck and
cheek.  He did not require intubation, and the angioedema
resolved with dexamethasone. He developed nodules on his face
and neck; biopsies revealed neutrophilic dermatosis, c/w Sweet
Syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis.
.
Found to be hypercalcemic with low albumin levels and ionized
calcium of 1.61 on day prior to transfer. PTHrP and PTH were
sent with Vitamin D studies. These were pending at the time of
transfer.
.

[**2122-9-16**] Chest X-ray: FINDINGS: Lung volumes are low, and apical
lordotic projection and portable technique also contribute to an
accentuation of the cardiomediastinal contours. Patchy opacities
are present at both lung bases, and may reflect atelectasis in
the setting of low lung volumes. Differential diagnosis includes
aspiration and early infectious pneumonia. Followup PA and
lateral radiographs are suggested when the patient's condition
permits.

[**2122-9-17**] CT Head: No evidence of acute hemorrhage
[**2122-9-17**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1. No evidence of spinal or
paraspinal abscess. Note that if concern exists for focal
discitis or osteomyelitis, MR would be the more sensitive
modality for evaluation.
  2. Nodularity of the pancreas and left adrenal gland. Given
history of
previous lung malignancy, metastatic disease is the primary
consideration at the pancreas. Additionally, though the adrenal
nodule is statistically likely an adenoma, metastatic disease
must be considered. Ongoing followup is recommended with repeat
CT within 6 months, or with comparison to prior
imaging.
  3. Large bilateral consolidations in the lower lobes
bilaterally. Given the history of fever and cough reported on
the previous chest radiograph, these are concerning for
infectious pneumonia. Nevertheless underlying mass is not
excluded. Followup to resolution is recommended.
  4. Large mediastinal lymphadenopathy as detailed above.
  5. Numerous healing left lateral rib fractures as well as
deformity in the right sixth rib, presumably post-surgical.
----------------
[**2122-9-18**] EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to reduced
voltage,
slowing, and disorganization of the background rhythm. These
findings
are suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy involving
both
cortical and subcortical structures. Medications,
toxic/metabolic
disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There
were no areas of prominent focal slowing although
encephalopathies can
obscure focal findings. There were no clearly epileptiform
features.
---------------
[**2122-9-18**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Limited study. No significant aortic or mitral
regurgitation seen. Grossly preserved biventricular systolic
function

Brief Hospital Course:
# Fevers: Transferred from outside hospital with pathologic
diagnosis of Sweet's Syndrome, based on skin biopsy and
persistent fevers/leukocytosis. The patient was febrile from his
first day on the floor. Initial infectious workup including
blood and urine cultures was unrevealing. Stable infiltrate
opacities on OSH CXR may represent PNA, especially in setting of
productive cough. CT of the chest revealed large bilateral
consolidations, and the patient was started on broad antibiotic
coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia, including vancomycin
and ceftriaxone. The patient underwent lumbar puncture with IR
guidance, which yielded ~15 cc of bloody CSF. Initial gram stain
on the CSF revealed gram negative rods, and ampicillin was added
for potential listeria meningitis, in the event that the gram
negative rods reported on gram stain were actually gram
variable. The CSF gram stain findings were subsequently changed
from gram negative rods to ""no organisms."" Infectious disease
was consulted prior to the above CT findings, and initially
recommended holding antibiotic therapy, as well as sending a
number of serologic infectious studies (HSV PCR in CSF, VZV PCR,
West [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, Eastern Equine Encephalitis PCR, enteroviral PCR,
mycoplasma PCR, VDRL per ID). He was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics that were eventually tapered to doxycyline.  The
patient underwnet TTE, to evaluate for fever of unknown origin.
No vegetations were noted.  Rheumatology was also consulted, and
they recommended tapering the patient's dexamethasone, as the
patient's fevers were clearly not responding to the steroid
treatments. He also underwent bone marrow biopsy; pathology is
pending.

# Mental status changes/Delirium: The patient was clearly
confused and disoriented, which--per the family's report--was
strikingly different from his baseline cognition/personality.
Potential etiologies were thought to include infectious
(meningoencephalitis, abscess or non-CNS infection),
metabolic/endocrine (hypercalcemia), renal failure/uremia,
hepatic encephalopathy, or persistently febrile state. It was
thought unlikely to be hydrocephalus or brain metastases from
unknown primary (hx of lung CA), given reportedly normal OSH
imaging. Toxicology screens were negative. Liver function tests
were benign. EEG revealed mild to moderate encephalopathy
involving both cortical and subcortical structures, without
epileptiform features. The patient's mental status seemed to wax
and wane somewhat in proportion to his fevers; he would be more
engaged and responsive to questioning when afebrile.

# Leukocytosis: The patient had reportedly undergone bone marrow
aspiration at the OSH, with findings consistent with
myelodysplastic syndrome. His WBC count increased rapidly to
47,000. Hematology/oncology was consulted and performed another
bone marrow aspiration to further assess the leukocytosis.
Marrow analysis is pending.

# Hypercalcemia: Calcium was highly elevated at OSH, where he
received pamidronate treatment prior to transfer. On arrival
initial calcium levels were measured at 12.1, with an albumin of
2.6. PTH levels were elevated at 106. PTHrP was sent off to an
outside lab. His calcium trended downwards after receiving
pamidronate.  Endocrine was following and suspect primary
hyperparathyroidism.
.
# Hypotension: Per patient's family, he has never had difficulty
with high or low blood pressures, and was not on home
anti-hypertensives. He had had very limited PO intake over the
2-3 weeks prior to admission. He was initially placed on
maintenance IV fluids, and subsequently had the rate of infusion
increased.  He transiently required vasopressors while in the
unit.
.
# History of carcinoid syndrome:  His lung cancer was found to
be carcinod.  Endocrine was consulted and felt his symptoms were
unlikely to be carcinoid-mediated.  Chromogranin A and 5-HIAA
were sent and are pending.
.
# HIT:  His HIT antibody returned positive and he was started on
Argatroban.  SRA was sent and is pending.  LENIs were negative
for clot.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Patient required intubation on [**9-19**].
This was due to ARDS; he was initiated on ARDSnet ventilation.
He had difficultly oxygenating and required high PEEPs directed
by balloon.
.
# Mediastinal lymphadenopathy:  Unclear etiology.  Patient was
not stable enough for biopsy.
.
Patient acutely decompensated on morning of [**9-25**].  Patient was
made CMO by family.  He died that day.  Autopsy is pending.

acting right"" and was diaphoretic and called EMS -> [**Hospital1 63695**]. There, he was noted to be bradycardic (HR 40s) for
which he received 0.5 mg atropine X 1. He was hypertensive with
sbp 180s and a nitro gtt was started. He was noted to be
acidotic (7.062/72.1/100) with acute renal failure (Cr 5.3) and
CK 3000. Reportedly, his NG lavage revealed ~ 100 cc maroon
blood and his rectal exam showed gross blood. He received 2u
PRBC and was emergently intubated and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management. Given reports that he had fallen 2 days
earlier (the patient does not recall this event), the patient
was evaluated by trauma surgery. He underwent extensive CT
imaging (head, neck, chest, abdominal, pelvis), which was most
notable for ileal thickening. He was extubated this a.m., and,
given no clear surgical cause was found, he is being transferred
to medicine for further management.

to the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details.
In summary she had: Aortic valve replacement, 21-mm St. [**Hospital 923**]
Medical Biocor Epic tissue valve. Her bypass time was 71minutes
with a crossclamp of 56 minutes. She tolerated the operation
well and following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-op day one beta-blockers and diuretics were started and
she diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Ampicillin was started
for a positive urinalysis.  It was discontinued when the culture
revealed no growth, and follow up urinalysis was negative.  Also
on this day she was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol. She progressed well during
post-op period and worked with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. The remainder of her hospital course was uneventful.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB/CP/AF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2171-4-9**] - Redo Sternotomy, MV Repair (30mm Band), Full MAZE
Procedure.
[**2171-4-12**] - Exploratory diagnostic laparoscopy conversion to open.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 y/o gentleman admitted for a redo mitral valve
repair and MAZE procedure. He has undergone several PVI
procsdures for AF with his last being complicated by tamponade
requiring emergent sternotomy. He now has 3+ MR documented by
ECHO. He is admittedprior to surgery after stopping his coumadin
for IV heparin in preparation for surgery.

Past Medical History:
-Atrial fibrillation
-Atrial flutter
-Hyperlipidemia, diet and exercise controlled
-Mildly elevated LFTs
.
CARDIAC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation approximately four years ago. In [**2169**], he was
evaluated at [**Hospital1 112**] and subsequently underwent a pulmonary vein
isolation procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**]. Unfortunately, that
procedure was complicated by a left ventricular hematoma and
perforation resulting in a cardiac tamponade and cardiac arrest.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken emergently to the operating room for relief
of his tamponade. He was in the intensive care unit for
approximately 15 days and ultimately discharged one month later.
Unfortunately, postoperatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 65974**] to atrial
fibrillation and was discharged on amiodarone.
.
In [**3-28**], he was found to be in atrial flutter, with heart rate
in the 120s. At that time, his [**Date Range 8863**]-XL dose was increased, he
failed DC cardioversion, and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
In [**2169-4-22**], he underwent successful ablation of reentry
around the anterior portion of the CS ostium by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
which was complicated by a prolonged vagal response and
post-procedure hypotension requiring dopamine infusion, IV
fluids, and atropine for resolution.  He was admitted to the
CCU, and at that time developed CHF which was likely  [**2-23**] to
fluids given for hypotension in setting of decreased HR after
ablation.
.
In [**12-28**], he was found at his follow-up visit to be back in
aflutter. In [**2170-1-22**], a second atrial flutter ablation
procedure was performed.
.
In [**1-28**], he had a successful atrial flutter ablation, completion
of previously done TV-IVC isthmus line of block.
.
In [**3-29**], his amiodarone was discontinued after PFT's revealed a
mild restrictive physiology and LFT's were found to be elevated.
.
In [**11-29**], he presented again with symptomatic palpitations and
was started on Digoxin. He had a repeat PVI on [**2171-1-24**] and
propafenone was initiated post-procedure.  DCCV on [**2171-1-29**].

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of tobacco use.
There is no history of alcohol abuse. He was formerly a
Pediatrician for 18 years in [**Country 3992**] prior to emigrating to the
US ten years ago. He is married with three sons.


Family History:
His father died of complications of diabetes. There is no family
history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-4-23**] 4:18 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluation of infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with s/p mv repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluation of infiltrate
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.

INDICATION: Status post mitral valve repair. Evaluate for
infiltrates.

[**Hospital **]: This is the first PA and lateral chest examination
since the preoperative study before mitral valve re-do operation
obtained on [**2171-4-7**]. There is status post sternotomy,
including a row of cutaneous surgical clips in the midline. A
left subclavian central venous line is in place, seen to
terminate overlying the SVC at the level of the carina. No
pneumothorax is identified. The overall heart size is now only
slightly larger than it was on the pre-re-do examination of
[**4-7**] and the cardiac configuration remains the same. A
left-sided lateral pleural sinus obliteration has developed and
as it does not continue into the posterior pleural sinus, it
most likely represents postoperative scar formations. Comparison
also reveals additional linear densities and a relatively
crowded vasculature in the left lower lobe consistent with
partial atelectasis, but no new parenchymal infiltrates are
identified. When comparison is made with the most recent single
view portable chest examination of [**2171-4-19**], the
previously present multifocal parenchymal densities as well as
pleural densities have regressed markedly and there is no
evidence of new acute infiltrates or increased pulmonary
congestion. As already noticeable on previous postoperative
examinations, there exists a faintly visible semi-circular thin
density consistent with a surgically performed mitral
annuloplasty.

IMPRESSION: Marked improvement of pulmonary infiltrates
encountered postoperatively to mitral valve annuloplasty and
MAZE procedure ([**2171-4-9**]). Moderate cardiomegaly as
before, presently no signs of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Left-sided basal scar formations and partial atelectasis.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS

Reason: r/o bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 54-year-old male with concern for intracranial
hemorrhage or infarction. The patient is recently status post
mitral valve replacement.

COMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT [**2171-4-15**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT followed by CT angiogram of the
neck, head and circle of [**Location (un) 431**] after Optiray IV contrast with
multiplanar reformats and 3D reconstructions.

CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Overall, the appearance of
the brain is unchanged compared to [**2171-4-15**]. There is no evidence
of intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or vascular territorial
infarction. Paranasal sinus mucosal thickening has improved and
there is mild residual mucosal thickening of the floor of the
right maxillary sinus and of the left sphenoid sinus air cell.
There remains a small amount of fluid and a few bilateral
mastoid air cells; however, a majority of air cells remain well
aerated.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE NECK WITH IV CONTRAST: The carotid and
vertebral circulations are patent without evidence of aneurysm,
stenosis, dissection or vascular malformation. At a level
slightly superior to the carotid bifurcation, the left internal
carotid artery measures 10 mm maximal diameter. Slightly
inferior to the skull base, the left ICA measures 5 mm. At
similar reference levels, the right internal carotid artery
measures 9 and 6 mm respectively. Limited visualization of the
upper lungs demonstrate airspace consolidation at both apices as
well as moderate-sized pleural effusions layering dependently.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD AND CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The anterior and
posterior circulations as well as circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent
without evidence of aneurysm, stenosis, dissection or vascular
malformation.

CT PERFUSION: The CT perfusion images are somewhat limited due
to technical artifacts; although, no definite asymmetric
perfusion defect is seen.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage.

2. Unremarkable CT angiogram of the neck, head, and circle of
[**Location (un) 431**].

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with s/ mv repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Apparent anterior displacement of the lateral masses of C1
relative to the occipital condyles is incompletely evaluated on
this head CT. Further evaluation with noncontrast CT of the
cervical spine is recommended.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 54-year-old male found to have apparent anterior
dislocation of the lateral masses of C1 relative to the
occipital condyles on recent head CT, referred for evaluation of
the cervical spine.

COMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT, [**2171-4-15**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the cervical spine with
multiplanar reformats.

[**Month/Day/Year **]: There is no evidence of fracture or malalignment of
the cervical spine. The vertebral body heights are maintained.
There is no significant central canal or neural foraminal
stenosis. There is normal articular alignment of the bilateral
lateral masses of C1 with their respective occipital condyles.
There is no evidence of anterior dislocation of the lateral
masses of C1 relative to the occipital condyles which was
suspected on a limited evaluation by recent head CT. Paranasal
sinus mucosal thickening and partial opacification of bilateral
mastoid air cells are incompletely included in the field of
view. Ground- glass opacity and interstitial thickening is noted
of the visualized right lung apex. The patient is intubated with
terminus out of view.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal articulation of the lateral masses of C1 with their
respective occipital condyles.
2. No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
3. Paranasal sinus mucosal thickening and bilateral mastoid air
cells partial opacification not fully evaluated.
4. Ground-glass opacity at the visualized right lung apex may
relate to infection as suspected on the patient's recent chest
radiographs.

CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2171-4-13**] 1:06 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C

Reason: pna, bowel ischemia

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with unexplained acidosis, question of pna
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pna, bowel ischemia
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Unexplained acidosis, question of pneumonia and
bowel ischemia.

TECHNIQUE: Axial volumetric images have been obtained through
the chest, abdomen and pelvis before and after administration of
IV contrast. Delayed images in the venous phase through the
abdomen and pelvis have also been obtained. Coronal and sagittal
reformats were performed.

CT CHEST: There are multifocal airspace opacities within the
right and left lung, predominantly on the right with evidence of
ground-glass opacities and air bronchograms. There is a
questionable small right apical pneumothorax with no evidence of
mediastinal gas. Endotracheal tube is in place. The heart is
enlarged with evidence of small amount of pericardial effusion.
Mediastinal catheters are in place. There are shotty mediastinal
lymph nodes which are all less than 1 cm in diameter in short
axis. There is no evidence for pleural effusion. There are two
hypodense nodules within the right thyroid lobe for which an
ultrasound is recommended.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The patient is status post recent laparotomy
two days ago. There are residual two small pockets of free air
superior and anterior to the hepatic dome. The liver, the
spleen, the pancreas, and the bilateral adrenal glands are
unremarkable. The gallbladder appears slightly thick-walled and
this is likely due to the presence of small amount of ascites in
the abdomen. There is a short segment of proximal small bowel
that is prominent measuring 3.2 cm in diameter. There is no
evidence of transition point. The remainder of the bowel appears
unremarkable. This is most likely due to postsurgical changes.
There is no evidence of pneumatosis or portovenous gas. Small
amount of free fluid in the abdomen. There are slightly
prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes, all of which are
subcentimeter in diameter in short axis. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis. There is a small left upper pole cyst.
Otherwise, the bilateral kidneys are unremarkable.

CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder is decompressed with evidence of
Foley catheter in the bladder. There is a small amount of free
fluid in the pelvis. There is a right-sided femoral catheter
within the right femoral artery. There is mild subcutaneous
edema.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are no lucent or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. Evidence of multifocal airspace disease concerning for
multifocal pneumonia. [**Hospital **] were communicated to the fellow
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59499**] on [**2171-4-13**] at 4:00 p.m.

2. Questionable small right apical pneumothorax which may be
tracking from catheter placement. Additional foci of gas in the
anterior abdominal wall as described may also reflect gas
tracking from the mediastinal catheters.

3. Two hypodense lesions within the right lobe of the thyroid
for which an ultrasound is recommended.

4. Slightly thick-walled gallbladder which may be related to the
small amount of ascites in the abdomen. Focal short segment
dilatation of jejunum with no evidence of transition point. This
is most likely post-surgical in nature.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2171-4-8**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease and his atrial
fibrillation. As he had stopped coumadin, heparin was started as
a bridge to surgery. On [**2171-4-9**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent a redo sternotomy with a
mitral valve repair using a 30mm band and a full MAZE procedure.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated.
Throughout the day, he became progressively agitated with an
increase lactate causing acidosis. He was subsequently
reintubated to protect his sternum and to allow his acidosis to
clear. He developed copious secretions and an elevated white
blood cell count. Vancomycin flagyl, ciprofloxacin and ceftaz
were continued for coverage. An echo was performed which ruled
out a ventricular septal defect. The infectious disease consult
was obtained and a pneumonia was suspected. The general surgery
service was consulted given his acidosis and distended bowel. An
exploratory laparotomy was performed which was negative. He
developed rapid atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was
continued. Heparin was also started for anticoagulation. The
nutrition service was consulted and tube feeds were started for
nutritional support. The neurology service was consulted
secondary to his continued unresponsiveness and CTA imaging was
not suggestive of any acute process. An EEG was performed which
was also negative. A toxic-metabolic encephalopathy was presumed
possibly secondary to sedatives. Slowly his confusion and
agitation improved. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. On [**2171-4-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a catatonic state
and a head CT scan was performed which was negative. Of note,
thyroid nodules were seen on his scan which should be followed
as an outpatient. He quickly improved to his baseline. Later on
[**4-19**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated. As Ceftaz and flagyl were
associated with increased risk of seizure, they were both
discontinued as they had completed their course. A bedside
swallowing exam was performed which he failed and tube feeds
were continued. On [**2171-4-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was alert, orientated and
following all commands. Coumadin was resumed for paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. A repeat swallowing exam was performed on
[**2171-4-22**] which he proved that he could safely tolerate foods. A
regular diet was thus started. Later on [**2171-4-22**], he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. He continued to make steady
progress and was discharged to home on postoperative day 15.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56 y/o female with h/o HTN who presented s/p VFib arrest
with large anterior MI s/p cath with POBA.
.
#Cardiac
.
a)Ischemia: Pt had a large anterior MI. An IABP was placed in
the cath lab due to the size of the infarct as a prophylactic
measure, but overall she did well and it was weaned off and the
balloon was d/c'd after the 18 hours of integrillin had
completed its course. She was started on metoprolol and this was
titrated up. Lisinopril was restarted as well as plavix, statin,
ASA.
.
b)Rhythm: s/p VFib and PEA arrest. Pt was monitored on telemetry
and had no further events. EP was consulted and obtained a
signal average ECG on [**9-4**] to determine if a defibrillator might
be appropriate in the future.
.
c)Pump: Echo post-event showed an LVEF of 35-50%. She was
restarted on lisinopril. She has been scheduled for a repeat
echo in 1 month to determine if an ICD might be indicated given
the VFib arrest.
.
# Infiltrates on CXR with ? of hemoptysis at OSH:  She was begun
on empiric treatment for PNA at the OSH with ceftriaxone and
flagyl. She improved and was changed to levofloxacin PO to
complete a 7 day course. (last day [**9-5**])
.
# Mental Status: pt was down for many minutes before
resuscitation occurred. In the hospital she was noted to have
problems with short term memory. She was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
with neurology who specializes in memory loss that occurs in the
setting of VFib arrests and he felt that the pt would likely
recover most function given some time.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year old gentleman from [**Country 2045**], with a
history of cryptogenic cirrhosis (?NASH) c/b by ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, muscle wasting and varices s/p banding in [**2169**],
who was admitted with confusion, found to have SBP. He most
recently had a MELD of 22 ([**2174-2-7**]), and is undergoing Liver
Transplant Evaluation (on transplant list). On day prior to
admission, his son found that he was confused while talking on
the telephone (son had described this as garbled speech).
Patient also had abominal distention/discomfort for several days
prior to admission, as well as nausea and vomiting on the day
prior to admission. He had not been taking lactulose for 4 days
prior to admission. He had no other medication changes; he was
not taking any Tylenol, NSAIDs or alcohol. Of note, he has
diuretic refractory ascites and recently underwent therapeutic
paracentesis with 10.5L removed on [**2174-3-18**].
.
He was brought by EMS to [**Hospital3 **], where FSBS was noted to be 5
(?erroneous).  He had acute on chronic renal failure with
leukocytosis, elevated potassium and elevated LFTs; he recieved
3 nebs, 2 amps of D50 and one amp of sodium bicarbonate, and was
transferred with D10 running at 150 cc an hour. He had a
negative CT and CXR prior to transfer. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**],
initial VS were 96.5 91 108/57 16 100% 2L. Initial labs revealed
a lactatemia to 5.6, [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr to 2.9, transaminitis with
ALT/AST 2400/500. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed evidence of
SBP with an absolute PMN count of 1830. His UA was likewise
suggestive of UTI with WBC and bacteria, though he had a recent
foley placed. He received 1LNS, vanco and zosyn up front, and
later CTX following the paracentesis result. On the medicine
floor, he has been afebrile and normotensive. The team held his
diuretics and nadolol, but treated with ceftriaxone and albumin
overnight.
.
On transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10, patient was comfortable. He denied any
abdominal pain. He is unsure of whether he has a fever. No chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, BRBPR, melena,
cough, constipation.

Past Medical History:
-cryptogenic cirrhosis diagnosed [**2167**] during GIB, currently on
transplant list
-esophageal varices s/p banding [**2169**]
-hepatic encephalopathy

Social History:
He denies EtOH in the US, but admits drinking minimally in
[**Country 2045**]. Lives with his son and daughter-in-law locally. [**Name2 (NI) **] denies
smoking currently, but smoke [**5-8**] cigarettes for ""a year or two""
when he was in his early 20s. Denies illicit drug use. He is
from [**Country 2045**] and came to the US in the mid [**2142**]. He is single and
has 3 children.

Family History:
Mother died of asthma at 65, father alive and well, no health
concerns (age 72). No h/o CAD or MI.

.
[**2174-3-29**] RUQ U/S w/Doppler: The liver is shrunken and nodular,
consistent with known cirrhosis. No focal liver lesions are
seen. There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The
common duct could not be visualized. Concentric gallbladder wall
thickening likely relates to third spacing given the presence of
cirrhosis and moderate ascites. There is sludge as well as a
developing stone within the gallbladder. The spleen is markedly
enlarged, measuring 19.3 cm. There is a moderate quantity of
free fluid in the abdomen. The pancreas is not well assessed
secondary to overlying bowel gas.
Color and spectral Doppler imaging was performed of the hepatic
vasculature. The main portal vein is patent with hepatofugal
flow. The main hepatic artery has a normal arterial waveform
with a brisk systolic upstroke. The IVC is patent.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent main portal vein with hepatofugal flow.
2. Cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension
including moderate
ascites and splenomegaly.
3. Sludge as well as a developing stone within the gallbladder.
.
[**2174-4-5**] EGD: 3 cords of grade I varices were seen in the lower
third of the esophagus. Scar tissue from previous banding was
noted. Stomach mucosa: diffuse friability, erythema and
congestion of the mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in the

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 58yoM with cryptogenic cirrhosis presenting
with confusion and asterixis, who was found to have SBP and
acute on chronic kidney disease, accompanied by metabolic
acidosis.
.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient had abdominal
distention and discomfort along with fevers and confusion prior
to admission, with asterixis on presentation. Diagnostic tap
supported diagnosis of SBP with PMN count of 1450, despite the
slightly hemorrhagic tap. Cause of SBP is currently unknown,
though it likely contributed to his significant confusion prior
to admission. He was treated with ceftriaxone 2g q24hr x 5 days
and albumin. Repeat tap showed no continued SBP. He was then
started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO daily for prophylaxis.
.
# Encephalopathy: Patient with noted confusion and garbled
speech prior to admission. This is most likely multifactorial
from SBP, as well as acute liver on chronic liver failure and
non-compliance with lactulose at home. Along with current
confirmed SBP, patient has elevated transaminases in the
thousands, without a clear source, as RUQ U/S with Doppler
demonstrated no portal vein thrombosis and no other medication
changes or recent toxins. Mental status cleared with treatment
of infection and consistent lactulose use.

.
# Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Presented with decompensated cirrhosis
with rising transaminases into the thousands, elevated INR and
bilirubin, and low albumin. MELD on admission was 40. Infection
with organ hypoperfusion was most likely the cause of
decompensation. The patient was treated with vitamin K PO for
elevated INR. EGD demonstrated Grade II non-bleeding varices. He
was evaluated by transplant surgery for possible transplant and
transferred to the SICU and on [**2174-4-6**] he was taken to the OR for
ABO incompatible liver transplant with splenectomy. He was taken
to the OR with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. At the time of surgery, they
proceeded with a side-to-side caval cavostomy due to the size
mismatch between hepatic veins of the donor and  recipient.
There was initially low flow through the portal vein, prior to
completing the portal venous anastomosis, an eversion
endovenectomy was attempted and this was marginally successful.
then once the liver was implanted, completion of a jump graft
SMV to PV conduit was done, and once hepatic arteries were
completed the liver pinked up. Portal flow was checked intra-op
by radiology showing satisfactory flow. Once all connections and
splenectomy were completed, the patient was markedly
coagulopathic and despite the addition of factor VII and blood
product replacement, the medical bleeding was continuing. At
that time it was decided to pack the patient with a laparotomy
sponge, temporary abdominal closure and planned return in 24
hours for closure.
On [**2174-4-7**] the patient was taken back to the OR,an abdominal
washout and liver biopsy were done. The abdomen was closed.
Of note, the patient received plasmapheresis prior to the
transplant with splenectomy and received daily plasmapheresis
through [**4-17**] and then again on [**4-19**] in response to Anti A and
Anti B titers above accepted range. On [**2174-4-20**] the titers were
noted to be Anti A 4 and Anti B negative. No further
plasmapheresis was required and the catheter was removed. Of
note, the patient received 7 doses of ATG through POD 6. (575
grams total) He received routine ABO incompatible Steroid course
and then followed prednisone taper per protocol. MMF has been
given at 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] since transplant and Prograf was started on
POD 1 from original transplant, and levels have been monitored
with dosing changes as appropriate.
Patient was transferred from the ICU once stable.
He was started on tube feeds on POD 7, which seemed to be well
tolerated, however the existing drains appeared to become more
milky in appearance, and the triglyceride level was almost 700.
The patient was made NPO, Tube feeds were stopped and the
patient had a PICC line placed and was started on TPN for bowel
rest. Over the course of the next few days, the drainage became
more serous in appearance again, nutrition consult was obtained
to find the most low fat tube feed, and he was started on
Vivonex, and was given counseling regarding a low fat diet.
The lateral drain was removed on POD 18, and the splenectomy bed
drain was removed on POD 23.
He was tolerating the new tubes feeds, but still had poor oral
intake. The patietn was having increased diarrhea with negative
c diff, and the tube feeds were switched to nepro with
additional benefit of lower potassium in feeds. He is tolerating
these tube feeds and has now progressed to a regular diet, with
the JP drainage remaining serous in appearance.
He is ambulating with assist, and has been recommended to be
discharged to a rehab facility for further physical therapy.
.
# Acute kidney injury: most likely prerenal azotemia from
hyperperfusion in the context of SBP (with peripheral
vasodilation). Urine was very concentrated with ketones,
suggesting hypoperfusion. Capillary leak from hypoalbuminemia
also contributing. Kidney function improved with treatment of
infection and administration of albumin. Once the patient
received the liver transplant, his renal function was already
recoved, and has continued to be within normal limits
.
# Metabolic acidosis: Patient presented with metabolic acidosis
with elevated lactate, likely due to intravascular depletion and
hypoperfusion in the setting of SBP. Also elevated in context of
liver disease (liver clears 70% of lactate). Lactate trended
down to 1.9 with treatment of infection and administration of
lacutlose. Bicarbonate also corrected to normal.
.
# Hyponatremia: Most likely from third-spacing with decreased
intravascular sensed volume. Patient was supplemented with
albumin, with improvement of sodium.  Since liver transplant
this has normalized
.
#. Cachexia: Very cachectic, secondary to cirrhosis. Dobhoff for
supplemental nutrition was placed at the time of EGD, but
patient self-discontinued this tube. Tube feeds with Vivonex at
95cc/hr were initiated post chyle leak. He developed some
diarrhea with this tube feed, and has now been switched to Nepro
with improved tolerance.
Patient is now ambulating with assistive device and physical
therapy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and h/o TBM s/p
tracheal stent [**2144**] who presents with respiratory distress. Of
note he was recently admitted to the medical service [**Date range (1) 12721**]
with increased respiratory distress, felt at that time to be due
to mucous plugging. He received ceftriaxone and azithromycin
during that admission, which were stopped prior to discharge and
respiratory status was improved by discharge. Patient developed
increased cough [**5-27**] and started on levofloxacin as an
outpatient without significant improvement. He was initially
evaluated at an OSH where vitals were 98.8 88 115/47 24 95% on
4L. Given 40mg lasix - apparently without benefit. CBC there
with WBC 11.6, 19% bands per OSH records. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ER, vitals were 100.9 114 148/76 98% 3L -> 100% on BiPAP.
 Exam with rhonchi with supraclavicular retractions. CXR showing
mild pulmonary edema. Given vanco, ctx in ED, respiratory
attempted secretions but too thick. IP called - stent is in same
place, plan for scope in MICU. Started on BIPAP and admitted to
MICU for further care.

RADIOLOGY:
CXR ([**5-28**]):
1. Mild CHF.
2. Tracheal stent appears to lie slightly to the left relative
to the
tracheal contour. A CT of the chest is suggested to exclude a
tracheal stent migration.
.
CXR ([**5-29**]):
Evolving airspace change, particularly in the right mid zone
suggestive of
pneumonia. Generalized peribronchial cuffing suggestive of
left heart decompensation.
.
CXR ([**5-31**]):
FINDINGS: New tube overlies the proximal trachea and may reflect
a
tracheostomy tube. Preexisting Y-stent within the trachea and
main bronchi
appear unchanged. Interval worsening of pulmonary edema as well
as slight
progression in degree of right lower lobe atelectasis with
associated
elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Probable adjacent small right
pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
.
CXR ([**6-1**]):
FINDINGS: Tracheostomy tube and Y-stent remain in place in the
airways.
Interval improvement and pulmonary edema which is nearly
resolved, as well as improving aeration at the right lung base
with some residual minor atelectasis remaining as well as a
persistent elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Minimal patchy
opacity at the left base also likely represents atelectasis,
accompanied by a small pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 80M w COPD (on home Bipap)), pulmonary
fibrosis, and tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent in [**2146**], PVDz
s/p LE stenting on Warfarin, Parkinson's dz, and recent
admissions for similar complaints, who was admitted with
increased respiratory distress, s/p MICU stay.
.
# DYSPNEA: Likely multifactorial from combination of HCAP
(fever, cough, infiltrate on CXR [**5-29**], leukocytosis), acute
exacerbation of COPD from infection (given wheezing, O2
requirement), possible recurrent mucous plugging given extensive
baseline pulmonary disease/bronchiectasis. Acute on chronic
systolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 40% [**5-/2147**], mild pulm edema on
CXR at OSH) and aspiration in the setting of Parkinson's dz also
considered, esp w witnessed aspiration of chicken broth as
inpatient. ACS/PE seemed less likely, cardiac enzymes negative.
Sputum grew GNRs and Proteus, for which Meropenem was started
for a 10-day course ([**Date range (1) 51975**]). Blood cxs negative.
Bronchoscopy was performed and pt taken to the OR for
tracheostomy and T-tube placement for suctioning. Necrotic skin
was seen around the incision, hence vancomycin was started for a
10-day course ([**Date range (1) 72760**]). The COPD exacerbation was treated
with prednisone initially with 40mg, with plan for taper over 15
days.  Taper should begin on [**6-5**] at 20mg through [**6-7**], then
10mg on [**6-8**] to [**6-10**], then 5mg on [**6-11**] to [**6-13**], then 2mg [**6-14**] to
[**6-16**], then 1mg [**6-17**] to [**6-19**].  Patient was also treated with
bronchodilators/acetylcysteine nebs and supplemental oxygen as
needed. Pt evaluated w video speech and swallow, showed
Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of level 5, mild dysphagia,
recommended repeat instrumental evaluation at rehab prior to
upgrading patient's diet or if patient continues to improve.
Tracheostomy capped on discharge, which the pt is tolerating
well. Oxygenating on room air > 93%.
.
# tracheostomy site: it was felt patient had a tracheostomy site
infection, was initiated on vancomycin on [**5-29**], with plan to
complete 10d course, to end [**6-8**].
.
# Acute renal failure: Cr 1.5 up from recent baseline of Cr ~1.
Likely prerenal in the setting of diuresis, poor PO intake and
acute processes (infection). Lisinopril was held until Cr
resolved to baseline. Cr=1 on discharge.
.
# HTN: SBP varied in the 100-160 range given acute
hospitalization. Mostly in the 130s on discharge on home regimen
(diltiazem, lisinopril).
.
# Anemia: normocytic, likely [**2-19**] ACD and possibly acute losses
from procedures. Stable at baseline Hct ~30 on discharge.
.
# PVD s/p stent: Coumadin held for tracheostomy, restarted on
[**2148-6-3**], will need INR monitoring and adjustments in dosing.
Patient's coumadin was initially held, then restarted [**6-3**] at
7.5mg.  This will need to be followed at rehab, with goal inr 2
to 3.
- continue home ASA, statin
- continue coumadin - will need inr check until therapeutic
.
# Parkinson's dz: stable, continued home carbidopa/levodopa on
discharge.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: stable, continued home statin.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: stable, continued home venlafexine.

Chief Complaint:
Post-op care following thoracoscopic left ventricular lead
placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracoscopic left ventricular epicardial lead placements (2)
for BiVIDC
Removal of coronary sinus lead for BiVICD


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
83M s/p thoracoscopic LV epicardial lead placement x 2, removal
of coronary sinus lead [**6-24**]. Patient experienced increasing
shortness of breath over past year. States unable to climb one
flight of stairs without becoming breathless and ""things that
took 20 minutes now took one hour"" such as showering. Patient
also out of breath after walking about 15 yards. States that did
not have problems with PND and has always slept with 2 pillows,
mostly because of longstanding vertigo when lying flat. Patient
had BiVent placement [**5-18**]. He states that after leaving he had
couple of days of feeling better and then felt worse. LV lead
was found to be pacing the diaphram and device was turned off.
Patient went back to baseline functionality.
Post surgery, patient has had non-complicated course, with
removal of chest tubes and decreased pulmonary edema. His
creatinine increased from 2.4 baseline to 2.8. Today he states
that he feels dizzy, or lightheaded, when walking. The
lightheadedness does not occur immediately on standing but
usually starts when walking 10 yards. He also experienced it
when getting up and going to the bathroom and straining to have
a bowel movement. He states that the sensation is very similar
to other times in the past when he has felt lightheadedness on
standing, (not the same as his vertigo).

ROS: The patient admits to past history of some urinary
obstruction during hospitalizations and states that he
experienced this again yesterday, but improved with medication.
No nausea. No chest pain or history of chest pain. Reports no
history of leg edema.

SECOND ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3230**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7356**], MD (RES)

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.

OPERATIONS:  1.Thoracoscopic left ventricular lead placement
x2.
1.  Removal of coronary sinus lead.
2.  Multilevel Intercostal  nerve block.

OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
gentleman who had previously undergone percutaneous lead
placement attempt. This was unsuccessful, and as such, the
patient presented with the desire for thoracoscopic
placement. After discussion with the patient, it was decided
to proceed with thoracoscopic placement.  The risks and benefits
as well as possible benefits were explained to the patient
including but not limited to bleeding, infection, MI, CVA,
Death, nerve damage, heart damage, and lung damage and possible
blood transfusion and he agreed to proceed. All questions were
answered to his satisfaction prior to proceeding with the
procedure.

OPERATIVE COURSE:  The patient was brought to the operating
room and placed on the operating table. After the induction
of general endotracheal anesthesia, a right internal jugular
central line was placed. A transesophageal echocardiogram
monitor was used during the case. After anesthesia had
completed their invasive line, the patient was turned in the
right lateral decubitus position with the left side up. The
left thorax was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. A
2 cm incision was made along the fifth intercostal space. A
trocar was inserted. About a 10 mm 30 degree scope was
inserted. Upon inspection of the thorax, there was no
evidence of any abnormalities. The heart was fairly large.
Two other trocars were inserted, one in approximately the
sixth intercostal space and the other in the posterior
position. Two  graspers were used to elevate the pericardium.
A knife was used to incise the pericardium sharply, taking
care not to injure the myocardium. Next, the pericardium was
elevated and retracted, allowing access to the myocardium and
epicardium. Two epicardial leads were placed, using a device
which was able to screw the leads onto the epicardium. Each
epicardial lead was tested and was deemed to be working
appropriately with acceptable thresholds.

Once the lead had been placed, there were no areas of
bleeding after placement of the leads. Two chest tubes were
placed, both in the left hemithorax.

Then, the patient's previous pacemaker/defibrillator pocket  was
opened. We then tunneled the two leads to the infraclavicular
pocket. The
coronary sinus lead was evaluated and was removed by simple
traction. At this
point, the 2 left ventricular leads were attached to a Y
connector and were
deemed to be working appropriately after attachment. The
serial [**Serial Number 67550**]. The Y addapter was then connected to the
pacer/defibrillator box and resecured in the pocket after
meticulous hemostasis was achieved. All thoracic incisions were
closed in layers

We then performed a multilevel intercostal nerve block with 1/4%
marcaine with epi

Post operative course:
SOB: Patient has baseline SOB from heart failure. He stated that
on post operative day 3 from procedure, his shortness of breath
was improved somewhat from prior to procedure. He underwent
daily physical therapy consults, which demonstrated improved
functionality, although the patient had some orthostatic
hypotension and decreased oxygen saturation on ambulation. He
found manual respiratory exercises (percussion with cough)
performed by the physical therapist to be very helpful for his
shortness of breath. The patient was euvolemic on presentation
and appeared not to require his outpatient lasix dose, probably
due to improved heart function. By the end of his stay he had
developed some mild fluid overload and was discharged on lasix
40 mg every other day with instructions to titrate up or down
under the direction of his primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] ejection
fraction was measured as 35% with TTE postoperatively.
.
Post-op skin care: The patient had chest tubes postoperatively
which were removed without complication and was discharged with
instructions on care for the wound sites. Patient had also
developed a rash from removal of surgical tape and was given
silvadene cream for that.
.
3. Kidney function: Patient's creatinine increased from baseline
of 2.4 to 2.8 during stay, but was trending downward on
discharge. He may benefit from an ACE inhibitor as an
outpatient, as determined appropriate by his primary care
physician and cardiologist.
*
4. Anticoagulation: The patient was maintained on his regular
coumadin regimen.

History of Present Illness:
79 yo M with h/o RUE DVT, AFib on coumadin, PCM with h/o
infection, was brought to ED at [**Location (un) 11248**] [**Hospital3 **] in
NH on [**7-26**] after having passed out at shopping mall. Was found
bradycardic and hypotensive. CTA showed bilateral pulmonary
embolism with a large embolus in the L main stem PA. INR on
admission was 2.6, Cr 1.6, WBC 20.7 with 66.7%PMNs. LENI's were
negative but B upper ext U/S's revealed a 90% R subclavian vein
stenosis associated with pacer lead. The L subclavian/axillary
was patent with atretic with thickened calcified wall c/w
post-phlebitic changes. There appeared to be good collateral
flow around both subclavian systems, suggesting mostly chronic
condition. The vascular service at the OSH felt that the R
subclavian likely had the acute DVT which traveled to the
pulmonary artery. Echo showed large RA thrombus occupying approx
2/3rds of the RA.
    At the OSH he initially required Bipap to keep O2sats up and
was given Solumedrol. He was started on Vancomycin empirically
for leukocytosis with concern for infection of PCM leads. This
was later changed to Linezolid given concern that vanc had
caused renal failure? He was started on IV heparin and given
coumadin, aspirin 81, and plavix 75. Cr was seen to rise to 4.0.
Moxifloxacin was added on [**7-28**]. Troponin was initially 0.03 and
rose to 0.37. He is now admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
his right atrial clot and pulmonary embolism. Heparin and plavix
were continued for anticoagulation despite being therapeutic on
coumadin. Steroids and nebulizer treatments were given to
improve his hypoxia with good results. Given the nature of his
clot in relation to his pacemaker, the cardiac surgical service
was consulted for surgical removal of his pacer lead and atrial
clot. Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
and despite being such high risk, it was elected to proceed. The
electrophysiology service was consulted for interrogation of his
pacemaker and to make adjustments to assist with his
hypotension. Given his acute renal failure, the renal service
was consulted. A temporary line was placed for hemodialysis by
the radiology service. As a hypercoagulable state was suspected,
appropriate studies were sent per the hematology service. On
[**2120-8-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent removal of a right atrial clot, closure of PFO,
placement of pacer leads and placement of a new pacemaker.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. An emergency echocardiogram was
obtained for deteriorating hemodynamics. No significant
pericardial effusion was seen however mobile thrombus was seen
in the right atrium. His sternum was opened at the bedside and
CPR was initiated with success. His family was made aware of the
grave situation and supportive care was withdrawn. Mr. [**Known lastname 55086**] [**Last Name (Titles) 69415**]d shortly thereafter on [**2120-8-3**].

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR-guided double lumen PICC placement.
TEE cardioversion.


History of Present Illness:
69 year old man with a history of endstage cardiomyopathy (NYHA
class 4) and severe CHF with an EF of 15% (EF of 20% on
milrinone drip) as well as severe MR p/w increasing shortness of
breath an O2 requirements on increasing doses of Lasix. On home
scale the pt gained 6 lbs over the week, and was unable to stand
prior to admission. His urine output also decreased from
600cc/24hrs on [**8-16**] to 200cc/24hrs on day of admission. The pt's
wife also noted increased abdominal girth and pedal edema. +
orthopnea, + PND.

The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an
admission for ventricular tachycardia controlled on amiodarone.
His course was complicated by episodes of acute pulmonary edema.
On [**8-5**], the patient had a right heart catheterization which
showed a cardiac index of 1.8 that improved to 2.6 after
initiation of milrinone. Appropriate fluid status was maintained
with Lasix 20 mg po daily, and patient was able to breathe
comfortably on room air at discharge. Following his discharge on
[**2155-8-12**], the patient was able to ambulate and breathe
comfortably until [**2155-8-16**], when he began to develop shortness of
breath and developed an oxygen requirement that was increased
from 2L to 4L on the day prior to admission. The pt has also
been on spironolactone prior to discharge which was omitted from
his discharge medications and then re-started on [**2155-8-16**]. The
patient also reports that PICC line for milrinone drip had been
leaking.

EKG [**2156-8-18**]: Sinus rhythm with demand ventricular pacing.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-8-5**] the findings are
similar.

CXR [**2156-8-18**]: Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The position of
the pacemaker defibrillator leads in the right atrium and right
ventricle is unchanged as well. Multiple broken sternal wires
are seen, with appearances different compared to the prior study
being now divided into two parts. The vertical central lucency
projecting over the mid of the thoracic spine suggests sternal
dehiscence that may be worse compared to the prior film.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, increased since the
prior film as well as there is new worsening of the left lower
lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis. The upper lungs are
unremarkable. There is mild vascular engorgement consistent with
mild failure, but unchanged since the prior study.

TEE [**2156-8-20**]: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the right atrial
appendage The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three
aortic valve leaflets which are mildly thickened. Aortic
stenosis is present (not quantified). IMPRESSION: no
intra-atrial thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 year old man with a history of end stage
cardiomyopathy (NYHA class 4) and severe CHF with an EF of 15%
(EF of 20% on milrinone drip) as well as severe MR p/w SOB, DOE,
PND, weight gain of 6lbs in a week, likely due to CHF
exacerbation.

# CHF/Pump: On physical exam the patient appeared to be in
volume overload with JVD to angle of the jaw, bibasilar rales,
1+ pitting edema in the lower extremities, and distended
abdomen. This was consistent with symptoms of SOB, PND, DOE and
likely secondary to systolic and diastolic HF secondary to
increased intravascular volume.
He was diuresed with Lasix bolus 20mg IV and Lasix gtt at
2mg/hr. Milrinone was increased to 0.75, and he was continued on
spironolactone and his ACEi.

# CAD: He has a history of CAD, CK negative on this admission
with no chest pain and EKG that is unchanged. CHF exacerbation
unlikely to be secondary to ACS in this setting. He was monitor
on telemetry

# Rhythm: The patient was in paced rhythm on telemetry. He has a
history of v-tach which responded to amiodarone. Patient also
has ICD in place.

# Respiratory: SOB and increased O2 requirement were likely
secondary to CHF exacerbation and resultant pulmonary edema.

# Rheumatoid Arthritis: Swan neck deformities were stable.  He
was continued on prednisone 5mg po daily for RA control.

# Anemia: His HCT was stable. He was continued on ferrous
sulfate for anemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**12-1**].  An ERCP was perfored in the
ICU on admission.  This procedure required intubation.  Consent
for both the intubation and ERCP was obtained from the patient's
daughter (healthcare proxy).  ERCP revealed bile without pus in
the biliary tree.  There were no filling defects suggestive of
obstruction.

A subsequent CT scan revealed no source of abdomnal pathology
and a diagnosis of urosepsis  was made.  Over the ensuing 48
hours blood pressure required norepinephrine for support.  On
[**12-3**] a meeting was held with the family and and the decision
was made to remove the ETT and stop all pressors.

History of Present Illness:
80yoM with h/o biliary obstruction due to cholangiocarcinoma,
s/p stent placement with h/o prior VRE and Proteus septicemia,
presenting from rehab with fevers, lethargy.  Patient was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 66202**]/07.  At that time he was diagnosed
with Proteus and VRE bacteremia and a liver abscess as well as
SBP with peritoneal tap growing sacchromyces cervesiae. A
pigtail catheter was placed to drain the liver abscess.  He was
discharged to rehab on Flagyl, Cipro, and Daptomycin.  Of note,
during that hospitalization family meetings were held with
patient and his [**Date range (1) 802**].  It was determined that he did not want
to pursue further aggressive care or invasive procedures, and
that after rehab he would prefer hospice level care.
.
At rehab he spiked a temperature to 101.4 and exhibited
increasing lethargy, prompting transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**].  In the
ED T 98.2 HR 65 BP initially 89/58, improved to 101/72 after
1.5LNS, RR 16, 96%RA.  He had a CT abdomen performed which
showed persistance of catheter, decrease in size of old abscess
and question of new liver abscess.  He was treated with Zosyn
and Linezolid prior to transfer to the floor.
.
On presentation now he c/o minimal pain over drain site in RUQ.
He denies nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel movements.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-3-26**] CT ABD/PELVIS: 1. Significant interval decrease in the
size of the right hepatic lobe collection drained by the pigtail
catheter.
2. Significant interval increase in inferior right hepatic
abscess which is not drained by the indwelling catheter. A
second percutaneous catheter placement may be needed to drain
this collection.
3. Unchanged hypodense lesion within the left lobe of the liver,
which may represent a metastasis or a focus of infection.
4. Probably mild interval increase in intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation compared to [**2-12**], though comparison
is difficult given differences in technique. There is a small
amount of pneumobilia centrally within the liver, suggesting at
least partial patency of the common bile duct stent.
5. Large amount of stool throughout the colon.
.
[**2132-3-26**] CXR: 1. No evidence of pneumonia. Air within the
inferior right lobe of the liver is located within an abscess,
as seen on CT.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate.
.
[**2132-3-27**] ERCP: Previous placed stent had completed obstructed.
This was removed.
Biliary stricture compatible with malignant biliary stricture in
the middle third of the common bile duct and at the bifurcation.
A 60 mm X 10 mm covered wall stent was placed.
.
[**2132-3-30**] CXR: Worsening bilateral pleural effusions with likely
developing fluid overload/failure.
.
[**2132-3-31**] ECHO: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is severe regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mid to distal anterior/anteroseptal akinesis and apical
akinesis/dyskinesis (EF 25-35%). LV systolic function appears
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Suboptimal image
quality - patient unable to cooperate.
.
[**2132-4-1**] CXR: Uncomplicated placement of PICC line with
appropriate termination point.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Septicemia in setting of biliary stent occlusion and liver
abscess:  CT showed new liver abscess and worsening intrahepatic
biliary dilation.  Patient underwent ERCP for stent replacement
as well as placement of a percutaneous abscess drain done by
radiology.  LFTs steadily improved s/p ERCP.  He was maintained
on daptomycin and meropenem in house but will complete his
course on vancomycin and meropenem, given enterococcus is
sensitive to vancomycin.  Please check vancomycin trough on
[**2132-4-4**].  Plan for at least 4 weeks of antibiotics.  Patient is
scheduled for follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of infectious
diseases to follow-up an interval CT and for possible
discontinuation of his drain based on the CT.  A PICC is in
place for antibiotics.  He has been hemodynamically stable and
afebrile with these treatment interventions.
.
# Liver abscess: Abd CT showed decreased size of prior right
lobe abscess (pigtail in place), but new inferiorly located
right liver abscess (~ 6 cm).  Discussed with patient and his
HCP; he would not want surgery but was agreeable to IR drainage.
 Aspirin was held and procedure done.  His other drain was
discontinued.  Biliary stent also replaced this admission, which
may have been a contributing factor.
.
# Systolic CHF: Patient noted to have EF 25-35% on ECHO done to
rule out an overt vegetation.  He also complained of worsening
shortness of breath and had a chest xray which suggested
worsening CHF.  Patient was diuresed and creatinine remained
stable.  He remains stable on room air.  He has been started on
an ACEI and will need qd weight and dietary restriction for
continued management.
.
# Altered mental status: Improved.  Still agitated at night.
Remeron restarted.  Likely infection is contributing.  TSH and
B12 in normal range.
.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: Presumed based on imaging, not
biopsy-proven. Evidence of liver mets. Pt does not desire
chemo/surgery.
.
# Iron deficiency anemia:  Hematocrit stable at 33.  Labs from
[**2-6**] suggest iron deficiency.  Patient started on po supplement.

# DNR/DNI: confirmed with pt and HCP. During prior admit, there
was discussion of possible hospice placement. The patient/HCP
clearly state that they want minimally invasive procedures
(ERCP, abscess drainage) but are declining surgery. Palliative
care was consulted and assisted in discussions with patient.

Placement of temporary pacemaker line
Placement of permanent pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
85 yom with afib, dm, pvd, copd, h/o priof MI admitted to [**Hospital1 3325**] 4 days ago with acute SOB & chest pressure.  Patient is
wheelchair bound. According to notes, pt has been developed
chest pressure and shortness of breath on day of admission to
OSH.  He had a few episodes of this pressure during
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 46**].  The chest pressure occured along
with some sob, nausea and right shoulder pain.  Denied
diaphresis.  He had trop of 0.09. ECG showed intermittent CHB on
admission to osh.  Because of this he was taken of BB.  An Echo
was performed, revealing an EF of 30%.   He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for w/u of possible cardiomyopathy and catheterization.
.
Pt was admitted initially admitted to cardiology [**Hospital1 **].  He did
not have any complaints on presentation. He was given metoprolol
12.5mg at 8 pm and one hour later, while sleeping, was noted to
have complete heart block.  BP was stable and pt asymptomatic.
Episode self resolved.  However, given concern for intermittent
chb he was transferred to CCU.  He denied any complaints at time
of transfer.

[**6-3**]-CXR--REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the pacemaker
placement.
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to the previous film from
[**2128-6-1**]. The right atrium and right ventricle pacemaker
leads inserted on the left are in standard positions. No
pneumothorax or a pleural effusion. The heart size is enlarged
and the aorta is tortuous and calcified.
Multiple bilateral pleural plaques, including the bilateral
costal pleura and bilateral diaphragmatic pleural surfaces
suggest previous asbestos related disease.
IMPRESSION:
1. Standard position of the pacemaker.
2. Unchanged appearance of the bilateral pleural plaques
consistent with prior asbestos exposure.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 85 yom with h/o DM, paroxysmal afib, severe peripheral
vascular disease s/p multiple bypass grafts, copd and remote MI,
who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardiac
catheterization and EP evaluation.
The pt was initially admitted to the cardiology [**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital1 18**],
where, after recieving a dose of beta-blocker before bedtime, he
had 20 minutes of complete heart block.  The episode was
asymptomatic.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for closer
observation and placement of a temporary pacemaker wire, which
was uncomplicated.  The following day ([**6-1**]) pt had a permanent
pacer implanted (DDD).  Since admission to [**Hospital1 18**] the pt has had
low BP's (SBP-80's to 100's & occasionally lower).  His
anti-hypertensives were held because of this.  The pt was noted
to be volume overloaded, and was given IV Lasix (20mg) PRN.  He
diuresed well, and his SBP would often improve following
diuresis.  This lead us to conclude that he likely had active
CHF, leading to poor forward flow & a pre-renal state.  Because
of this, he discharged on PO lasix.
.
Other issues:
.
#) CV
-CAD: Given pt's h/o CAD, he was treated with ASA, statin, &
plavix during his admission.  Once BP improved, b-blocker
therapy was resumed; however, he was unable to tolerate more
than a few doses.  His ACEi was also held because of low BP.
The pt did not have CP/pressure during his admission here.  At
[**Hospital3 3583**] the pt did have chest pressure and borderline
elevated troponins.  However, given the pt's age & physical
status (minimal activity & wheelchair bound), we felt that the
risks of cardiac catheterization out weighed the benefits, and,
thus, we did not pursue catheterization during this admission.
-Pump: Pt reportedly had an EF=30% from an echo done at OSH.  He
did show signs of volume overload and presumed CHF while here,
which were treated with diuresis.
-Rhythm: Episode of complete heart block treated with permanent
pacemaker.
.
#) Renal - The pt was in acute renal failure (thought to be
pre-renal) with Crt peaking at 1.8 and trending down to 1.5
after diuresis.  (It was thought that due to volume overload and
CHF, the pt had poor forward flow, leading to hypo-perfusion of
his kidneys.)
.
#) PVD - Patient has an extensive history of lower extremity
bypass surgeries.  He was noted to have two left lower extremity
ulcers which were treated with wound care.  No evidence of
cellutis.
.
#) Diabetes - The pt's home gluburide was discontinued while
hospitalized and he was covered with RISS.  He will be
discharged on glypizide (rather than glyburide) given his
decreased renal function: crt clearance estimated at 33.
.
#) Paroxysmal afib. - no documented a. fib on tele at OSH or at
[**Hospital1 18**].  Coumadin was re-started here following EP recomendation.
 However, it was later discontinued as pt was felt to be at high
risk for falls and would be receiving aspirin and plavix for his
CAD.
.
# )COPD - Patient has history of emphysema (20 pack-year smoking
history) and asbestos exposure.  He was given nebulizers &
inhalers prn.
.
# AAA - per outside records, pt has AAA of ~2 cm width.  No
interventions undertaken while in hospital.
.
#) Thrombocytopenia - Pt's plts were noted to have dropped from
159 to 130 at OSH, and initially 125 here.  Cause unclear.  It
resolved on it's own.
.
#) Dispo - Based on pt's inability to perform his baseline
physical activities (ie, transferring, etc...), physical therapy
recommended that pt go to rehab for further strengthening and
conditioning prior to going home.  Pt initially refused, but
later agreed once his family discussed the issue with him.

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 50416**] is a 67F with a PMH s/f pulmonary hypertension,
sarcoidosis and colon cancer on chemotherapy (s/p C3D15 of
cetuximab/rinotecan on [**4-8**]) who is presenting with a [**2-16**] day
history of chest pain.  The pain is described as substernal,
pleuritic, sharp, radiating to her back, unchanged quality from
prior. Pain initially [**10-24**] in severity.  Associated symptoms
include dyspnea, the patient denies diaphoresis, nausea or
vomiting. No F/C, denies [**Month/Year (2) **].
.
In the ED, initial VS were T: 97.2F, BP: 142/92, HR: 102, RR:
20, 100% 4L NC (on 3L NC at home). An EKG showed NSR with
nnormal axis and intervals and no ischemic ST or T-wave changes.
Initial CK was flat at 50, with troponin slightly elevated to
0.1, from a recent baseline around 0.8. A CTA was negative for
pulmonary embolism and demonstrated a new RUL opacity tracking
along the fissure, and thought by radiology to most likely
reflect plate-like atelectasis related to her history of
sarcoidosis. She was, however, given a dose of levofloxacin
750mg IV. Lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVTs.  Her
labs were otherwise normal except for her baseline elevated
bicarbonate. She was given Morphine IR 2mg IV x 3 for chest
pain, with some effect. Incidentally, patient has not taken any
of her antihypertensives today.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2177-4-13**] 2:35 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: eval for PE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman with SOB, pleuritic chest pain, metastatic
cancer and edematous left leg with hypoxia on room air in the
70s
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 67-year-old woman with known sarcoidosis, metastatic
colon cancer, now with dyspnea.

COMPARISON: CTA of the chest from [**2177-3-28**] and CT of the
torso from [**2177-3-11**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed
before and following intravenous contrast administration.
Multiplanar reformations were obtained.

FINDINGS: There are no central or segmental filling defects
within the tortuous and enlarged pulmonary arteries, whose
appearance is unchanged compared to prior studies. The heart
size is stable with atherosclerotic calcifications noted within
the coronary arteries as well as within the thoracic aorta.
There is no significant pericardial effusion. No lymphadenopathy
is appreciated. The thyroid remains heterogeneous with isthmic
and right-sided hypodensities suggestive of nodules.

Within the lungs, again noted is fibrosis and traction
bronchiectasis involving primarily the upper lobes. In addition,
there is a newly apparent more consolidative opacity in the
right upper lobe, tracking along the fissure and to a lesser
extent in the left upper lobe also along the fissure. There are
no pleural effusions. The central airways are patent.

In the visualized upper abdomen, note is made of an incompletely
evaluated large hypodense left upper quadrant mass whose
appearance is similar to the prior studies, measuring upwards of
9 cm. A calcified retrocrural lymphadenopathy is also noted and
unchanged. A hypodense posterior right lobe of the liver lesion
is stable.

IMPRESSION:

1. New opacity tracking along the major fissures bilaterally in
the upper lobes is suspicious for superimposed infection in the
setting of chronic changes due to sarcoid.

2. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.

3. Enlarged pulmonary arteries, unchanged.

4. Large left upper quadrant abdominal mass and retrocrural
calcified lymphadenopathy, similar to prior studies and
compatible with metastatic disease.

5. Heterogeneous thyroid.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient initially presented for admission with shortness of
breath and persistent chest pain on [**2177-4-13**]. Initial evaluation
was generally unremarkable with LENIs negative for DVT, CTA not
suggestive of PE. She was diuresed with lasix prn. She also had
her pain medications uptitrated and in the setting of her new
pain regimen, she developed hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
distress on [**2177-4-14**], necessitating transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and
NIPPV. At that time, her initial ABG was notable for PCO2 of
132. Patient improved significantly after receiving BiPap and
was called out to the floor.
Again on the floor she developed increased confusion on [**4-18**] with
slow response to questions and PCO2 of 97. She received NIPPV
overnight and improved and was called out to floor. On the floor
she received BIPAP at night. Received 500cc [**4-21**] for hypovolemic
hyponatremia and 1000cc on [**4-22**], and 1 unit PRBCs on [**4-23**].
Developed increased RR on [**4-23**] to 26-30 and CXR was c/w volume
overload. She received 20 IV lasix on [**4-23**].
During her course her O2 was again increased to 97-100% and she
developed progressive somnolence. ABG was 7.26/99/32, placed in
BIPAP without improvement (7.22/107/62). She was given 40 IV
lasix and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for noninvasive ventilation.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was started on bipap.  Respiratory therapy was
consulted and she transitioned to bipap at night only.  Her
mental status and O2 sats improved and she remained on 3L nasal
canula during the daytime.

Again 2 days later the patient developed mild confusion with
slow response to questions. ABG at that time was notable for
PCO2 97. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of
NIPPV.
During her hospital course patient had numerous transfers to the
ICU for mental status changes and respiratory failure, which
became increasingly difficult to control, she was DNR/DNI and
remained BiPAP dependant. On [**4-30**] her respiratory status did not
respond to NIPV and she died in hypercarbic respiratory failure.


Remaining hospital course by issues:

.
#. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: pt c/o SOB, O2 2L with O2
sat of 92% and initial improvement of her symptoms. Etiology of
patient's propensity towards hypercarbic distress was likely her
multiple primary pulmonary pathologies, including pulmonary
hypertension, sarcoidosis, diastolic dysfunction, and presumed
obstructive sleep apnea. These, coupled with narcotic use for
pain related to malignancy require careful management to prevent
inappropriately high bicarbonate levels. Treated with BiPAP
8/5/30%, aimed to avoid further sedating medications, continued
hydroxychloroquine and prednisone for sarcoidosis, continued
sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension and albuterol prn.
.
#. Hyponatremia: presentation and urine lytes c/w SIADH in the
setting of pulmonary disease. Fluid restriction of 1.5L, and
continued salt tabs. TSH cortisol normal and less likely to
include in the differential.
.
#. Anemia: stable, continued ferrous sulfate.
#. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine 25mcg PO daily
.
#. Anxiety: low-dose ativan PRN.
.
#. Hypertension: continued nifedipine and metoprolol
.
#. Pain control: Acute Pain consult requested by ICU team prior
to transfer. Fentanyl TD increased from 12 to 25 mcg/hour.
Patient refused morphine PCA, as recommended. Continued fentanyl
TD at increased dose, continue standing acetaminophen 1 g q6
hours, oxycodone PRN, Neurontin 300 mg qHS.

There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of
normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large
vascular
territorial infarction. Periventricular and subcortical white
matter
hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with
age-related
involutional change. Bilateral cavernous carotid artery
calcifications are
noted. There is an old small left cerebellar hemisphere lacune
(3:7). The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well
aerated. The imaged osseous structures are intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was an 86 year old female with a h/o AML/MDS and
symptomatic anemia, on decitabine (cycle 1) who presents with
septic shock with likely pulmonary source. Pt made [**Last Name (LF) 3225**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
family and patient wishes.

Initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for septic shock. The
patient's family were present on admission and they noted that
she had a living will stating her wishes to be DNR/DNI and to
avoid invasive procedures. The family elected to avoid the
insertion of a central line and thus stop pressors. The levophed
was stopped and her blood pressure decreased to SBP 50s-60s.
Fluids and antibiotics were continued in a hope that her
infection could be treated to possibly go home. The following
day, her pressures had improved to SBP 80s-90s. Blood cultures
showed gram positive cocci in clusters. On further discussion
with the family, they opted to stop antibiotics entirely.
Patient was made [**Hospital Ward Name 3225**] and was called out to the floor on [**2193-3-19**].
The patient passed away on [**2193-3-22**]. Family declined autopsy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to ED with c/o abdominal pain. She
underwent a CT scan which revealed an anastamotic leak. She was
taken to ICU due to clinical presentation and low blood
pressures, and taken to OR immediately for repair.
.
Operative course was prolonged, but uncomplicated. She was
admitted to ICU post-operative. Remained in ICU for blood
pressure support for a few days. She was transferred to Stone 5
once medically/surgically stable.
.
She remained NPO with IV fluid, IV antibiotics, abdominal JP
drain, and Foley in place for a few days. Given sips for
comfort. Diet advanced slowly-according to ostomy function. Few
episodes of N/V with attempted advancement of diet. Ostomy
teaching initiated with patient and family. Physical Therapy
consulted. Rehab suggested post-discharge. Facility screening
intiated.
.
Vitals stable. WBC chronically elevated. Patient afebrile.
Continued with antibiotics. Abdominal wound opened at
bedside-started vacuum dressing. Titrated antibiotics according
to culture data. Anti-fungal started. Infectious Disease
consulted, and continued to adjust medications. Patient
worked-up thoroughly for source of infection, elevated WBC.
Central line changed over wire (patient with poor peripheral
access), tip sent for culture, resulted in no growth. Treated
for multifocal pnemonia and UTI. No PE/DVT noted via imaging.
Patient's clinical status did not improve. CT scan of abdomen
obtained on [**2160-4-20**] revealed fluid collection between rectum and
vagina. CT guided draingage completed on [**2160-4-22**]. Specimen sent
for culture, results pending. No drain left in place. Double
lumen Picc line placed for prolonged antibiotics. Patient will
continue another 10 days of antibiotics/antifungals per ID
recommendations. Weekly labwork will be completed including
Vancomycin trough.
.
Respiratory status: continues with IV lasix twice a day with
frequent checks of serum potassium. Diureses over 7 liters
overnight from [**Date range (1) 99521**]. Bilateral lung sounds improved.
Decreased crackles, and supplemental oxygen requirements.
Current saturations over 95% on RA. Continue IV Lasix as needed.
Switch to PO once tolerating clears/regular diet. Discontinue
Lasix once Respiratory status stable.
.
Vacuum dressing held over weekend, and Dakin's solution dressing
applied [**Hospital1 **] for about 2 days. Wound appeared deeper with more
purulent, malaodorous drainage. Vacuum dressing re-applied on
[**2160-4-21**]. Normal saline moist to dry dressing applied for
transfer to REHAB. Vacuum dressing to be re-iniated at REHAB
facility.
.
Bedside Speech/Swallow evaluation to rule out aspiration on
[**2160-4-22**]. Patient passes evaluation. Cleared for thin liquids,
whole pills with water, and advancement to regular, ground foods
as tolerated.
.
Double lumen PICC line inserted at bedside on [**2160-4-22**]. Placement
confirmed via Chest XRAY.
.
Central line removed at bedside on [**2160-4-22**] prior to transfer to
REHAB.
.
Plan for follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] in [**2-5**] weeks for assessment of
surgical wound, and nutritional status.

Chief Complaint:
Planned admission for ERCP to dilate post-stent stenosis of CBD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
Biliary drain procedure by IR X 3


History of Present Illness:
70 year old female with a history of metastatic colon ca to
liver and lungs, admitted following ERCP to dilate post-stent
stenosis of CBD.  Briefly Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 98372**] was diagnosed with
metastatic Colon cancer in [**2148**] and treated with resection and
5FU / Leucovorin. Unfortunately she had a recurrence in [**2152**]
with mets to liver and lungs. She has had multiple biliary
stents placed in the past for obstructive disease. Recently her
bilirubin has been elevated and she has undergone several ERCP's
with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] who was unable to remove all of the sludge
distal to the stents. Her chemotherapy regimen has been held for
the past several weeks due to the elevated bili and it was
recommended that she have the percutaneous biliary procedure
which was performed on [**6-6**].  She was then re-admitted on [**6-12**]
at which time IR replaced her percutaneous biliary drain.
.
According to the preliminary procedure documentation:
1. Previously placed metal stent was seen in the major papilla
with distal occlusion.
2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon
catheter using a free-hand technique.
3. Cholangiogram showed partial stent occlusion with a normal
right hepatic system. The left hepatic system was dilated with
the external biliary drain in place.
4. Biliary Sludge was extracted from the biliary stent with a
balloon catheter.
.
ROS: Feels sleepy after procedure but otherwise well.  No
f/c/n/v/SOB since recent discharge. Last BM today.

[**6-18**] ERCP
Procedures: Biliary Sludge was extracted from the biliary stent
with a balloon catheter.

Impression: 1. Previously placed metal stent was seen in the
major papilla with distal occlusion.
2. Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon
catheter using a free-hand technique.
3. Cholangiogram showed partial stent occlusion with a normal
right hepatic system. The left hepatic system was dilated with
the external biliary drain in place.
4. Biliary Sludge was extracted from the biliary stent with a
balloon catheter.
.
[**6-19**] Tube cholangeogram
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 8.5-French right biliary
drainage tube, placed through the stent within the common bile
duct into the duodenum for internal drainage.

Successful replacement of pre-existing left biliary drainage
tube with a 6F nephrostomy catherter for external drainage.
.
[**6-21**] CXR
There is a large mass (4.7 x 5.7 cm) at the left lung apex.
Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, no CHF, focal infiltrate
or effusion is identified. The patient's numerous pulmonary
nodules are faintly visible. Drains noted over the upper
abdomen. No acute pneumonic infiltrate identified. Tip of right-
sided Port- A-Cath type catheter overlies the SVC/RA junction.
.
[**6-21**] EGD:
Impression: The esophagus was normal.
The stomach was normal with no blood within.
The ampullary area was examined using a duodenoscope. There was
a small mount of ooze around the previously placed metal stent.
The IR placed biliary stent could be seen within the metal
stent. There was no blood draining from the stent. The ooze was
flushed several times and seemed to be originating from the
periampullary area secondary to trauma from IR stent insertion
+/- metal stent change of position. The oozing had stopped by
the end of the procedure.
.
[**6-21**] GI Bleeding study:
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for 90 minuteswere obtained. A left
lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.

Dynamic blood pool images show increased uptake throughout
possibly small bowel seen only in the delayed images (60-90).
The precise cause of the increased uptake or the location cannot
be determined.

IMPRESSION:
Increased uptake possibly in the small bowel seen only in the
delayed images (60-90min) likely representing slow upper GI
bleeding.
.
[**6-25**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple lung nodules at
the lung bases. The largest is located within the left lower
lobe and measures 2.9 x 2.1 cm and previously measured 2.7 x 2.0
cm. A right upper lobe nodule has increased in size and now
measures 0.6 x 0.6 cm (series 4, image 1). The patient is status
post PTC and two catheters are seen within the liver entering
via frontal and right lateral approaches. There is a small
amount of perihepatic and perisplenic ascites. A common bile
duct stent is unchanged in appearance. The subcapsular mass in
the lateral right lobe which previously measured 2.1 x 2.2 cm is
now ill- defined, perhaps secondary to phase of contrast
administration, but measures approximately 2.2 x 1.2 cm. There
remains mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, which has
decreased and an expected small amount of pneumobilia. There is
evidence of tumor extension up the porta hepatis encircling the
left portal vein, decreased compared to the prior study. Lymph
nodes within the porta hepatis, some with mucinous calcification
are unchanged.

A cystic lesion in an enlarged spleen is stable. Cysts in the
right kidney are also unchanged. The pancreas, right adrenal
gland, left kidney, and stomach are unremarkable. A new 1.6 x
1.0 cm left adrenal nodule likely represents metastasis. Small
retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet criteria for pathologic
enlargement. There is a small ventral hernia containing
unremarkable appearing mesentery.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, bladder, and uterus are
unremarkable. There is mild sigmoid diverticulosis. There are no
enlarged lymph nodes and no free fluid within the pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval progression of disease. New left adrenal lesion
suspicious for metastasis. Enlargement of right upper lobe
pulmonary nodule. The right lateral hepatic lesion is more
ill-defined but has likely mildly decreased in size as has tumor
extending up the porta hepatis.
.
[**6-26**] Cholangiogram:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral cholangiograms performed demonstrate decompressed
system and right-sided biliary catheter retracted into the liver
parenchyma. The left- sided biliary catheter presents in good
position and drainage of the left- sided biliary ducts.
2. Successful exchange for right-sided biliary catheter for a 10
French biliary catheter, the pigtail was coiled in the duodenum.
.
[**6-30**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Smaller apparent size of left apical mass, which may related
to technique. If detailed comparison for interval change is
desired, then PA and lateral radiographs could be helpful.

2. Bibasilar opacities, probably atelectasis

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 F metastatic colon ca admitted for for ERCP to dilate
post-stent stenosis of CBD.
# Hyperbilirubinemia:  It was never completely clear why we were
unable to get her bilirubuin down further than we did.  The CT
scan did not show progression of disease. ? [**2-15**] paraneoplastic
syndrome.  However, after multiple ERCP/IR procedures (detailed
below), her bilirubin started to trend down by discharge.
- On [**6-18**], she underwent successful ERCP during which they
dilated the distal CBD stent stenosis.  She was started on
Levofloxacin after this procedure.
- On [**6-19**], IR placed a drain to her R biliary system that was
also internalized to her duodenum.  They also replaced her L-
biliary drain (this could not be internalized).
- On [**6-21**], she had a lg amt of marroon blood per rectum.  A
bleeding scan suggested an upper-GI bleed.  She was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and an EGD was performed which showed a slow bleed
from around the site of entry of the CBD into the duodenum,
thought to be secondary to prior procedures.  The bleeding had
stopped by the end of th EGD.  Her hct was stable and she did
not require any transfusions during her hospital course.
- On [**6-21**], the same day that she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she
spiked a fever to 101.  CXR did not show a PNA and UA did not
show a UTI. Vanc/Zosyn were started with concern for biliary
source with possible catheter-site infection.  On approximately
[**6-27**], Vancomycin was stopped and she was switched to unasyn,
based on sensitivities (her biliary fluid grew out enterococcus
and K. pneumoniae.)  On [**6-30**], cipro was added based on new
sensitivity data for the K. pneumoniae and the fact that she
spiked a low-grade fever.  She remained afebrile for the
remainder of her hospital course.  On discharge, she was sent
out on augmentin and cipro to be taken ongoing.
- On [**6-26**], IR performed another cholangiogram as her bilirubin
was persistently elevated and her drains seemed only to be
intermittently draining.  They increased her R drain to a 10 F
and showed that the L drain was working.
- Prior to d/c we also consulted Hepato-biliary surgery.  They
stated that they could offer her a surgical procedure to attempt
to provide better drainage but based on the fact that here bili
began to trend down and her drains seemed to be working, she
decided to defer surgery for now.  She will have a f/u
appointment w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
- She is at very high risk for infection given her 2 biliary
drains.
.
# Hpothyroidism: cont armour

# HTN: atenolol held during her gi-bleed and for approx 6 days
after and re-started at a lower dose prior to d/c

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3565**]
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
CVVH
s/p pleurex placement for drainage
TIPS procedure which stenosed
s/p nephrostomy for obstructing left ureteral stone

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 49yo man with complicated past medical history including
multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia progressing despite
therapy c/b portal hypertension of unclear etiology s/p
abdominal pleurex catheter placement on [**2137-11-8**] for symptomatic
draininage last admitted with cellulitis in [**9-/2137**] now presents
with diarrhea and fatigue s/p PET scan foud to have
hyponatremia, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia.
.
He has currently been on pulses of Decadron 4 mg alternating
with 12 mg pulse therapy x four days and re-started [**Year (4 digits) 95263**] -
10mg po every other day.  On Tuesday given concerns about a
possible infection due to declining blood pressures, penile
irritation and leukopenia his decadron was decreased from 4 mg
to 2 mg po qd 2 days prior to presentation. He then had
increased fatigue one day prior to presentation. He does not
tolerate fatty foods well and is usually on a low fat diet. In
preparation for his PET scan he ate fatty foods and subsequently
developed diarrhea [**12-19**] loose bms. Upon arrival to the floor
this has ceased.  The stool was descrbied as brown with flecks
of blood. He did not have nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. He
usually drains 1-2L of fluid from his abdominal pleurex catheter
daily but it has decreased to 1L per day. He does have a stage
II decubitis which has become more irritated in light of the
diarrhea. He has not had any fevers, chills or cough.
He is currently being evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for treatment of
his portal hypertension. He is s/p liver bx with hepatic venous
pressure gradient also performed. Per his wife given the results
of the liver bx and the hepatic venous pressure gradient study
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] thinks that he is a candidate for a TIPS procedure.

IMAGING:

[**2137-12-12**] PET scan:
IMPRESSION:
1. No new FDG-avid disease identified. Previously seen right
retroperitoneal soft tissue mass has resolved.
2. Bilateral perinephric and left periureteral soft tissue
lesions are not well assessed on the present study and were
fully described on recent MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**2137-11-15**].
3. Increased moderate ascites.
4. Decreased small bilateral non-FDG-avid pleural effusions.
5. Slightly increased small pericardial effusion.
6. Unchanged mild left hydronephrosis.
7. Relatively increased FDG-uptake in the T2-T11 vertebral
bodies could be due to either recent radiation to this aspect of
the spine, or prior radiation to the remainder of the spine.

[**2137-12-13**] Renal US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal disease.
2. Multiple stones in left kidney with hydronephrosis which has
worsened
since the prior MRI in [**2137-11-5**]. Proximal hydroureter. No
definite
obstructing stone seen.
3. Cyst within the left kidney.
4. Nonobstructing stone in the right kidney.
5. Ascites.

[**2137-12-15**] MRI pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. This examination is limited somewhat by lack of
administration of
contrast; however, there is interval increase in size of the
perinephric
deposits surrounding the left kidney in particular suggestive of
disease
progression. The perinephric deposit surrounding the proximal
left ureter is stable. The overall moderate hydronephrosis and
proximal hydroureter in the left kidney is grossly unchanged
when compared to prior imaging.
2. Hemosiderosis.
3. Moderate volume intra-abdominal ascites also noted.

[**2137-12-18**] Renal US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable moderate-to-severe left hydroureteronephrosis with two
stones in
the lower pole calices. No calculi identified in the ureter. The
left
ureteral jet was seen.
2. Non-obstructive stone in the lower pole of the right kidney.

[**2137-12-25**] CT head:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process to explain
patient's
altered mental status.

[**2138-1-1**] ECHO:
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with abnormal septal motion
consistent with RV pressure/volume overload. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Trivial to very small pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-11-21**],
there is interventricular septal flattening consistent with
right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is greater, but may have been
underestimated on the prior study. The pericardial effusion is
slightly smaller.

[**2138-1-1**] Portable CXR:
IMPRESSION: Right basal opacity could reflect aspiration or
pneumonia.

[**2138-1-3**] Portable CXR:
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube ends 3.6 cm above the carina and is
appropriate in position, orogastric tube courses below the
diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is off
radiograph view and left internal jugular line ends at lower
SVC. Since [**2138-1-2**] right upper pneumonia has worsened and
moderate to large right pleural effusion persists. Left lung is
clear, no effusion. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours
are normal.

[**2138-1-4**] RUQ ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. Sludge within an otherwise normal appearing gallbladder.
2. Large volume ascites.
3. Right pleural effusion.
4. Patent TIPS.

[**2138-1-7**] Echo:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity
is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-1-1**],
the estimated PASP has increased slightly.

[**2138-1-8**]  abdominal US w doppler:
Kidneys are extremely echogenic and there is reduced
corticomedullary
differentiation suggesting significant impairment.
Mild fullness of the proximal ureters are seen, but there is no
good evidence of hydronephrosis. There is a 1.5 cm calculus in
the left kidney. There is likely a left-sided nephrostomy. The
right kidney measures 12 cm. The left kidney measures 11.2 cm.
There is a lower pole 9 mm right-sided non obstructing calculus.

CONCLUSION: Bilateral but likely nonobstructing calculi.
Extremely echogenic kidneys.

[**2138-1-8**] RUQ US:
CONCLUSION:
Findings suggestive mid TIPS stenosis and narrowing, although
the TIPS remains patent.
Large volume ascites. Small amount of sludge in the gallbladder.


[**2137-1-11**] CXR:
Multifocal consolidations appear unchanged on the right and
slightly worse on the left. The supporting tubes and lines are
unremarkable. There is
potentially slight interval decrease in right pleural effusion,
although it might reflect semi-upright position of the patient
as opposite to supine with layering of pleural effusions.





Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo M with h/o MM/plasma cell leukemia which was progressive
despite therapy c/b portal HTN of unknown etiology admitted
originally with diarrhea and acute renal failure with prolonged
hospital course complicated by significant RP plasmacytomas,
TIPS procedure which subsequently stenosed, obstructing left
ureteral stone s/p nephrostomy, respiratory failure requiring
intubation/ventilation, enterobacter/enterococcus septic shock
requiring levophed/vasopressin and renal failure requiring CVVH.


Ultimately, despite our best efforts, the patient's status
continued to decline.  He was continued on aggressive measures
up until the end, including pressors, CVVH, and mechanical
ventillation, but he finally succumbed to his illness on
[**2138-1-12**] at 11:27pm.  He passed away peacefully with family at
his bedside.  Please see below for a short summaries of the main
problems of his course.

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Septic shock with multi-organ failure: He was intubated on
[**1-2**] in setting of likely aspiration event and respiratory
decompensation and started on pressors for refractory
hypotension.  He was also on stress dose of steroids at this
time. Subsequent blood cultures grew enterobacter and urine grew
VRE. Both sputum and urine grew yeast, later speciated as
[**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis. He was treated broadly with meropenem,
daptomycin, and micafungin, then changed to linezolid,
tobramycin, meropenem, and micafungin.  Required vasopressin and
levophed to maintain pressures, eventually at max-doses with
continued refractory hypotension resulting in worsening renal
failure, respiratory failure, and liver failure.

# Respiratory failure: Intubated [**1-2**] for acute respiratory
failure following likely aspiration event.  Sputum had GNRs and
yeast at the time of enterobacter bacteremia, however then
consistently grew [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.  In the final days
before he died, he had increasing requirements on the
ventillator to maintain his sats, and chest xrays showed new
infiltrates that were likely due to ongoing aspiration events.

# Renal failure:  found to be in acute renal failure, with
creatinine continuing to trend up.  He has a known history of L
hydronephrosis, and given his worsening liver failure, there was
also concern for hepato-renal syndrome.  The patient was being
seen by hepatology and was s/p TIPS for reduction of portal
pressures.  The patient was maintained on midodrine and
octreotide initially for hepatorenal syndrome while in the ICU,
with doses being titrated up because of no improvement in his
renal funciton.  He was also started on albumin, which was
uptitrated to 100 grams daily.  Because of the evidence of L
hydronephrosis, the patient also underwent IR procedure and perc
nephrostomy tube was placed, which initialy drained bloody
fluid. His BUN/creat ultimately kept climbing, and because of
his worsening mental status, he ultimately was started on HD.
Midodrine and octreotide were stopped at that time. Pt then
developed sepsis (see above) and was unable to tolerate HD, so
he was transitioned to CVVH on [**1-3**]. Given his septic shock, at
that point it was thought that there was really no chance of
renal recovery, but CVVH was continued per request of the family
after discussion of goals of care.  It was continued until the
day that he passed away.

# Portal hypertension, liver failure: Known to have portal
hypertension, thought to be secondary to nodular regenerative
hyperplasia, unclear etiology.  Possibly due to his underlying
hematologic malignancy.  Patient underwent a TIPs procedure,
however this was found to be partially stenosed on admission the
ICU.  The patient was s/p TIPS on admission to the MICU, and on
ultrasound to evaluate TIPS patency, there was some initial
evidence of stenosis. He was initially maintained on
midodrine/octreotide, however as his sepsis picture worsened,
these medications were stopped.  His liver enzymes began to rise
slightly as septic shock set in, and his labs showed evidence of
liver failure with decreased synthetic function (namely, an
elevated INR).

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old lady with pulmonary HTN (on adcirca,
tyvaso, letairis), CAD s/p stents, HTN, and recent T5 + T8
compression fractures, diastolic CHF, and multiple other medical
problems who presents because she is feeling unwell and has been
short of breath lately.
.
She has been feeling unwell since her discharge from our
hospital on [**2135-6-7**]. At the previous admission she was found to
have two new spinal compression fractures at T5 and T8. She was
treated for pain with tramadol, lido patch, and tylenol, but
hasn't been taking her tramadol recently because she was worried
about its long-term effects. She states that she has been
splinting and not breathing well because her back pain worsens
with movement, breathing, and lying flat. Back pain is [**2133-4-16**].
She states that she is still ambulatory and has always been SOB
when walking, but it's worse now. She denies chest pain, cough,
or recent episode of choking. She has required 5L of oxygen
today but is usually on 4L at home.
.
As for her UTI, she denies dysuria, hematuria, urinary urgency
and frequency, as well as nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills.
She does endorse cloudy urine. She was discharged on her last
admission with cipro 500 [**Hospital1 **] x 8 days (ended [**6-8**]) to treat a
UTI.
.
Due to feeling poorly, she saw her PCP today, who referred her
to our ER. At home today her BP was low - 80/50. Of note, she
recently started hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg QHS three days ago.
She also complains of leg edema to her hips, but states it's
much improved today.
.
* has had pneumovax in last few years

Past Medical History:
- Coronary artery disease status post inferior MI with
subsequent Cypher stenting to the mid RCA in [**2130-4-11**].
- Non-ST elevation MI in [**2133-12-12**] with cardiac
catheterization that showed 80% OM1 lesion with subsequent
stenting of the OM with a 2.5x18mm Endeavor DES. The LAD was
stented with a 2.25 x 20 mm Taxus stents as well as an
overlapping proximal 2.25 x 8 mm Taxus stent.  This procedure
was
complicated by a small distal wire perforation without any
extravasation. Due to a balloon-induced dissection in the LAD, a
3.0 x 23 Promus stent was deployed as well as a 2.5 x 12 mm
Promus stent deployed in the LAD.
- Chronic dyspnea on exertion with diastolic dysfunction and
known pulmonary hypertension with right heart catheterization in
[**2134-11-11**] showing a PA pressure of 71/28 with a mean PA
33mmHg with a wedge of 8mmHg. She was not responsive to
vasodilator challenge in cath lab and thus is on advanced
therapy with adcirca and tyvaso reporting mild symptomatic
improvement.

Radiology:
[**2135-6-25**] Portable CXR:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increase in interstitial markings and an increase in diameter of
the pulmonary vasculature.  In conjunction with the increased
cardiac silhouette, these findings are suggestive of mild to
moderate pulmonary edema.  The presence of a minimal left
pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given blunting of the left
costophrenic sinus.  At the time of observation and dictation,
10:38 a.m., the referring physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 96051**] was paged
for notification, on [**2135-6-25**].
Given that no lateral radiograph was performed, the compression
fractures
cannot be evaluated.

CXR [**2135-6-24**]: FINDINGS: ""Massive degenerative changes in the
cervical spine, but no evidence of compression.  Mild
compression of T5, massive compression of T8.  As compared to
previous chest radiographs that are available from [**2135-6-22**], these changes are constant.  However, if compared to the
chest radiograph of [**2134-11-2**], these changes have
massively progressed. No evidence of new vertebral compression.
The lumbar spine shows anterolisthesis of L5 with respect to S1
and moderate degenerative changes, but no evidence of vertebral
compression.  Extensive vascular calcifications. ""

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-5-30**],
right ventricular cavity size is similar, but with more
pronounced free wall dysfunction. The estimated PA systolic
pressure is also lower. This suggests more prominent right
ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 79yo F w/ PMHx pulmonary HTN (dCHF and primary pulm
HTN related) (on adcirca, tyvaso, letairis), CAD s/p stents,
HTN, and recent T5 + T8 compression fractures, diastolic CHF,
and multiple other medical problems who presented on [**6-23**]
feeling unwell and short of breath.

Pt was admitted w/ suspicion for pneumonia. Chest X-ray showed
likely atalectasis, no definite pneumonia, but revealed
worsening of her known vertebral compression fractures since
[**2134-10-12**]. Her EKG showed evidence of a known inferior
infarct, but no ST elevations or depressions or T-wave changes
to indicate an acute process. Troponins were negative. She was
found to have UTI, and urine and blood cultures were sent. Pt
was given vancomycin and levofloxacin. Pulmonary was consulted,
who felt pt's dyspnea was likely secondary to atalectasis and
splinting from her compression fractures, not pneumonia or acute
worsening of PH, which is typically a more gradual process.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted, who felt she was not a
candidate for kyphoplasty. Her pain was treated with
acetominophen, tramadol and lidocaine patches PRN. On [**6-25**] she
received one does of morphine sulfate, which she did not
tolerate well, becoming confused and somnolent. That same day,
while receiving IVFs patient acutely desaturated, not responsive
to supplemental oxygen. Flash pulmonary edema diagnosed. She was
also found to be hypotensive, thought likely secondary to the
narcotic dose she had received. She was transferred to the ICU.

The patient presented to the MICU after triggering of the floor
for hypoxia and altered mental status. When the patient arrived,
she was somnolent but oriented to person, place, and time. The
patient appeared volume overloaded with elevated JVD, 3+ pitting
edema, and diffuse wheezing bilaterally. The patient's protable
CXR at the time that she triggered on the floor showed interval
progression of her pulmonary edema (of note, her diuretics had
been discontinued). The patient also had increased serum
creatinine from her baseline. Her constellation of symptoms were
thought to be due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute
on chronic right heart failure. Because of her low BPs, the
patient was bolused with IV lasix and started on lasix gtt. The
patient diuresed well to the lasix gtt. Her volume status,
oxygen requirement, and serum creatinine improved with diuresis.
Of note, the patient's lasix gtt had to be intermittently
stopped for SBPs in the 70s-80s. On the AM, prior to transfer to
the unit, the patient was noted to have MRSA in her urine. She
was continued on Vancomycin for treatment of MRSA bacteruria and
blood cultures were also drawn. TTE was done that did not show
evidence of vegetations. The patient was called out to the
Cardiology floor for further diuresis with lasix gtt.

Pt was stable on arrival to the cardiology floor, with
near-baseline oxygen demand and good urine output. She was taken
off the lasix drip, and given 60 IV lasix [**Hospital1 **], to match the
daily amount she had been receiving continuously. She tolerated
this well, and continued to put out good urine with stable
lytes. She was weaned to PO lasix 60 mg po bid. Letairis was
also discontinued per recommendation from pulmonary, who felt it
might be contributing to her dyspnea. She was discharged on a
higher dose of PO lasix (60 vs. 40 mg po BID), and was advised
to stop taking letairis. At discharge, pt's weight was 81.6
(measured late in the day; other weights taken in the early
a.m.), about 2 kg below her admission weight.

On the day before discharge, her [**Last Name (un) **], which had been held for
her [**Last Name (un) **], was reinstated at 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], half of her home dose; on
day of discharge her creatinine bumped to 1.2, and she had
systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s. These episodes were
asymptomatic, with good mentation and urine output, no chest
pain or increased shortness of breath. For this reason we
decreased her [**Last Name (un) **] further to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], and also decreased her
carvedilol, which had been increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] during her
inpatient stay, back to her home dose of 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] on
discharge. At discharge she felt at her baseline in terms of
breathing and activity, satting in the mid-90s on 4 liters of
O2.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Patient is highly sensitive to fluid balance; She seems to do
best at a weight of about 175 lbs, or 80 kg. Going forward, her
I's and Os should be strictly monitored, with daily weights
taken.

Patient is being sent out on bactrim DS for her MRSA UTI, which
was culture-proven sensitive to bactrim. She should take one tab
PO BID, last day [**2135-7-4**]. Of note, patient experiences
some nausea with this antibiotic, and should take this pill with
food, separate from her other medications to avoid loss of daily
meds through emesis. She has also responded well to taking
compazine shortly before taking.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay here at
[**Hospital1 69**]. You were admitted for
shortness of breath and fatigue. You were found to have a
urinary tract infection which we treated with antibiotics. You
were also found to be breathing less deeply because of back
pain, causing parts of your lungs to inflate less than normal.
With increased control of your pain, and use of your incentive
spirometer, this shortness of breath should improve. Some aspect
of this shortness of breath may have to do with a medication you
started recently, letairis, which we have discontinued.

You are being discharged to [**Hospital3 **] center. You
have appointments to follow up with your cardiologist's nurse
practitioner, and with your pulmonologist (see appointments
below).

We have made some changes to your medications. We increased your
furosemide (40 mg to 60 mg twice daily) and decreased your dose
of losartan (50 mg to 12.5 mg twice daily). You are also being
sent to rehab with 5 more days of Bactrim, the antibiotic for
your MRSA UTI, which you should take through [**7-4**]. Be sure to
review the medication reconciliation sheet to see what meds you
are currently taking.

Followup Instructions:
You have the following appointments with your specialists:

We are working on a follow up appointment in Pulmonary for your
hospitalization with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. It is recommended you be
seen within 1 week of discharge. The office will contact you at
the facility. If you have not heard within 2 business days
please call the office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M w/ presents from nursing home for fever, also with low
O2 sat to 89 on 6L, normally has 2 -2.5L home O2. Pt's family
notes that symptoms began on Friday when he was confused and
hallucinating. His wife visited him yesterday, and he was
complaining of severe shortness of breath when playing cards.
Nebulizers at that time helped. However, this morning, the
nursing home called the pt's family, informing them that they
were going to send him to the ED. The pt also reports that the
pt has been couhing and was needing 3L O2, with a temperature of
100.4. The pt endorses shortness of breath, unclear of when it
started, but also endorses a productive cough of yellow sputum,
denies hemoptysis. Pt denies leg swelling, though endorses
3-pillow orthopnea and PND. He denies chest pain, nausea, abd
pain. He denies hematuria but endorses dysuria that has been
going on ""for a while."" He also endorses good PO intake.

In the ED, initial vs were:  92 131/65 32 89% 6L. Exam was
significant for very mild wheezes, decreased breath sounds on

IMAGING
[**2173-4-11**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Low lung volumes with bibasilar
atelectasis. Difficult to exclude small right pleural effusion.
No definite evidence of pneumonia. If there is continued
clinical concern for the same, repeat radiograph in PA and
lateral projections would be helpful.

[**2173-4-11**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY: Extensive
mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, with narrowing of right
lower lobe bronchi, causing moderate right lower lobe
atelectasis, with a small right pleural effusion and small right
lower lobe consolidation. Multiple right pulmonary nodules
measure up to 11 mm. The findings are suspicious for a
neoplastic process. Reactive lymphadenopathy from infection is
also possible. No pulmonary embolus detected to the subsegmental
levels. Moderate atherosclerotic soft plaque throughout the
thoracic aorta. Severe coronary vessel disease.
Calcifications within the aortic valve. Please correlate with
any prior
echocardiograms. Cholelithiasis. Gynecomastia.

[**2173-4-13**] Ultrasound of lower extremity:  TECHNIQUE: Grayscale
and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] images obtained of the common femoral
veins bilaterally, left superficial femoral vein, left popliteal
vein, and left calf veins. The visualized vessels are patent and
compressible. Normal augmentation. No thrombus is identified.
There is arterialization of the SFV waveform with lack of
forward flow in diastole which could be in keeping with
congestive heart failure.
IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of DVT.

[**2173-4-13**] CXR:  FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**4-13**], there
are continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette and pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis and
probable small pleural effusions. Overall, there is little
change from the previous study.

[**2173-4-14**] CXR:  FINDINGS: Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar
atelectasis, left side more than right and small bilateral
pleural effusions are unchanged over past 24 hours.  Mediastinal
congestion is also similar. IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema,
bibasal atelectasis and small pleural
effusions are unchanged over last 24 hours.

[**2173-4-15**] CXR:  FINDINGS: Compared to the prior radiograph, there
is now mroe prominent interstitial thickening consistent with
worsening pulmonary edema. Again seen are small bilateral
pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and retrocardiac opacification,
likely atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation or
pneumothorax. Aorta is tortuous.
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening moderate pulmonary edema.
2. Stable bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with a PMH COPD on 2L
home oxygen and atrial fibrillation, who was admitted from
nursing home with fever and hypoxia, who was treated empirically
for RLL HCAP with vancomycin and Zosyn. Hospital course was
complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension,
requiring brief MICU stay for closer monitoring.  He then
experienced worsening respiratory failure and was made CMO prior
to discharge with plan for hospice.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient presented with hypoxia
to 89% on 6L supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. Hypoxia
occurred in the setting of baseline COPD requiring 2L of home
oxygen. In this circumstance, patient's poor lung function was
most likely exacerbated by a possible right lower lobe
pneumonia, noted on CXR but not on CTA. Additionally, x-ray
imaging showed some evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient was
evaluated by Speech and Swallow and was determined to have no
overt aspiration. CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Troponins were negative. The patient was placed on 4L NC, and
initially satted in the low to mid-90s. He was temporarily on
NRB and facemask, during which time he developed afib with RVR
and hypotension (se below). Pneumonia was treated empirically
with vancomycin and Zosyn.  On [**4-13**] he experienced flash
pulmonary edema in response to an episode of agitation and
hypertension.  His respiratory function continued to be poor
with NRB or high-flow face mask requirement despite diuresis and
antibiotics. This was thought to be due to HCAP, likely
post-obstructive, combined with flash pulmonary edema and
underlying COPD. He was not able to cough, and therefore was
unable to clear any infectious component. His prognosis was
thought to be poor given his lack of response to treatment and
progressive respiratory decline.  After transitioning to
inpatient hospice, the patient continued ipratropium nebulizers
as needed for comfort. He used a highflow facemask for
supplemental oxygen. Episodes of respiratory distress were
treated with morphine and lorzepam as needed. The patient
ultimately expired, with primary cause of death respiratory
failure.

# Fever: Low grade fever prior to admission and in ED was
attributed to possible RLL PNA. One set of BCx's did grow CONS,
but this was probably a contaminant. Other cultures returned
negative. As above, CTA was negative for PE. Patient was treated
empirically with vanc/Zosyn.  This was switched to an oral
regimen with Augmentin and azithromycin on [**4-14**]; antibiotics
were continued until decision was made to pursue comfort-focused
care.

# Afib: Patient had been well-controlled on digoxin and atenolol
for afib in the past. However, he developed RVR with rates up to
200. An acute episode was controlled with metoprolol tartrate 5
mg IV x3, diltiazem 5 mg IV x2 and metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO
x1, with subsequent return of rate to low 100s. Trigger for afib
with RVR was likely multifactorial from systemic stress of
infection, volume overload and possible hypercarbia. Patient was
asymptomatic during this episode. He was then started on
metoprolol tartrate with good rate control.  This was later held
for a day due to hypotensive episode on HD3, then restarted to
avoid Afib with RVR and subsequent flashing.

# Hypotension: On HD3, after receiving beta blockers and calcium
channel blockers for rate control, patient developed hypotension
to SBPs in the 70s-80s. This was most likely secondary to
medication effects and volume overload with relative
intravascular repletion. Differential also included pulmonary
embolism, myocardial infarction, sepsis and hypovolemia. LLE
Doppler was negative for DVT. EKG without any acute changes.
Patient appeared euvolemic on exam, but exhibited pulmonary
edema on CXR. He was transferred to the MICU for further
management and closer monitoring.  His anti-hypertensive
medication was held and his BP returned to [**Location 213**] levels.

# Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count now downtrended to 78 at its
nadir, but had values in the low 100s (113, 134) in [**6-/2172**] as
well. Unclear what pt's baseline is. No obvious signs of
bleeding. Other possible etiology is possible MDS. LFTs were
normal.

# AMS The patient experienced some delirium with reduced
orientation.  This was most likely due to pneumonia and
respiratory distress.  He had baseline dementia.

# ARF.  Increased creatinine from 1.0 to 1.3 on MICU admission,
returned to baseline 1.1.  Likely result of poor forward flow in
the setting of AF with RVR and may have pre-renal given poor po
intake, elevated BUN.

# AF.  Controlled with metoprolol and digoxin.  Metoprolol was
briefly held for hypotension.  Has CHADS at least 2, but not
anticoagulated, likely due to history of falls.

# Lung mass.  Incidental finding on CT chest. This was not
formally discussed with the patient or his family.  They prefer
to focus on comfort.

# Goals of care:  The patient's respiratory status continued to
degrade despite antibiotics and diuresis.  He was uncomfortable
on turning and dyspnic with mild exertion.  The patient and
family were against intubation.  He was maintained on
non-rebreather and high-flow face mask with some episodes of
dyspnea and shortness of breath.  These were managed with
morphine IV and then PO.  The Palliative Care team was consulted
for assistance with symptom management.  A family meeting was
held on [**4-15**] during which time the patient's poor prognosis was
reviewed.  They chose to focus on comfort measures and hospice
placement.  Antibiotics and most medications were discontinued.
Hospice care was continued on the medical floor, and he died
comfortably.

Date of Birth:   [**2096-2-11**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old man
admitted to Intensive Care Unit on [**2151-1-31**], from [**Hospital3 6265**] for evaluation of hematemesis, melena and abdominal
mass.  The patient had been doing well until the Tuesday
prior to admission when he developed a headache at which
point he took Vicodin and developed nausea and vomiting and
abdominal pain.  On the Thursday evening prior to admission,
he states he passed out on the floor of the bathroom and had
a fall secondary to severe pain.  He states that he had loss
of consciousness for about fifteen minutes.  He denies head
trauma.

On the Saturday prior to admission, the patient states that
he had some retching with blood.  He presented to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital3 3583**] where he was admitted
and found to have a hematocrit of 26.3, potassium 6.2, and he
was also in acute renal failure.  Abdominal CT indicated a
large peripancreatic mass.  The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.

On transfer, his white blood cell count was 28, and his
creatinine was 3.4.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of spontaneous pneumothorax.
2.  History of immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis.
3.  History of peptic ulcer disease, status post surgery.
4.  Acute renal failure.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Vicodin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states he is allergic to Sulfa,
Aspirin and Naprosyn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works in sales.  He has a twenty
pack year history of smoking.  He denies alcohol or street
drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient's
temperature was 97.0, heart rate 107, respiratory rate 15,
blood pressure 135/42, oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.
In general, the patient was alert, in no acute distress.  The
neck was supple.  Pulmonary examination indicated scant
crackles bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination indicated
regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a II/VI systolic
murmur.  The abdomen was distended with decreased bowel
sounds and mild diffuse tenderness to percussion.  On
extremity examination, the patient had 2+ peripheral pulses
with no edema.  His stool was guaiac negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies indicated a
white count 28.6, hematocrit 25.6, platelet count 404,000.
Chem7 indicated a blood urea nitrogen 43 and a creatinine of
3.4.  INR was elevated at 1.9.  Liver function tests were
within normal limits.

Electrocardiogram indicated normal sinus rhythm, rate 99
beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals and no
ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit.  Nasogastric lavage was performed which indicated
the presence of coffee ground emesis.  He was evaluated by
the gastroenterology service and emergent endoscopy was
performed which indicated the presence of a hiatal hernia as
well as compression of the second and third part of the
duodenum. A biopsy was taken at the compression site which
indicated chronic inactive duodenitis and focal Brunner gland
hyperplasia.  There was also gastric mucocele metaplasia.

CT of the abdomen indicated a 10 by 6.0 centimeter soft
tissue mass within the mesentery just below the pelvic rim as
well as a 10 by 16 centimeter mesenteric and retroperitoneal
hematoma displaying the duodenum anteriorly and compressing
the inferior vena cava.  Significant mesenteric
lymphadenopathy was also noted.

Renal and surgery services were consulted.  On the
recommendation of the surgery service, a follow-up abdominal
CT with p.o. contrast was completed which indicated
persistent intra-abdominal hematoma but no intra-abdominal
mass.  The patient was also now noted to have increased liver
function tests with an ALT of 622, AST of 649, and normal
total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

As the patient's hematocrit continued to drop, a bleeding
scan was conducted which indicated active bleeding into the
abdomen with no clear source.  The patient therefore received
an angiogram which indicated the presence of a superior
mesenteric artery aneurysm as well as active bleeding from
the gastroduodenal artery which was embolized.

The patient also developed shortness of breath following the
administration of a total of fourteen units of packed red
blood cells in the Intensive Care Unit.  Chest x-ray
indicated the presence of congestive heart failure and a
possible left sided infiltrate.  The patient was started on
Lasix as well as Levaquin and Flagyl.  A hepatitis panel was
sent which was negative.  ANCA was sent out of concern over
possible polyarteritis nodosa, however, this study was
negative.  The patient was also started on total parenteral
nutrition secondary to an expected ileus following
embolization.

While in the Intensive Care Unit following embolization, his
transaminases trended downward, and his creatinine improved,
and his hematocrit remained stable.  The patient did develop
transient episodic hypertension to a systolic pressure of 200
requiring Labetalol drip, however, this was successfully
weaned and the patient was transitioned to Labetalol tablets.
While in the unit, he also developed bipedal and scrotal
edema, which again was thought secondary to volume overload
in the setting of multiple transfusions.

Echocardiogram conducted on hospital day number four
indicated ejection fraction of greater than 55% with 1+
tricuspid regurgitation.

On hospital day number six, the patient was transferred to
the floor for additional workup of questionable abdominal
mass.  On repeat [**Location (un) 1131**] of the patient's existing CAT scans,
it was determined that what was initially read as a mass on
the first CT was likely to be extension of the hematoma.
Follow-up imaging in four weeks was recommended.

On his first day on the floor, the patient spiked a
temperature to 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  Repeat chest x-ray
indicated worsening pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally. At
this point, the patient was switched to Ceftazidime and
Clindamycin to treat possible nosocomial pneumonia.  Sputum
and blood cultures were sent which were negative.

The patient's pulmonary status improved significantly on
intravenous antibiotics.  As the patient was able to tolerate
p.o. intake, his total parenteral nutrition was discontinued.
However, the patient noted some pain with eating and was
found to have a small lesion at the site of his denture
insertion site.  The patient was able to tolerate food after
pretreatment with Viscous Lidocaine solution.

Although the patient's initial abdominal pain subsided, he
was maintained on Oxycontin for control of residual abdominal
pain while on the floor.  The patient's lower extremity edema
decreased with the administration of intravenous and then
subsequently p.o. Lasix.

On hospital day number ten, the patient was noted to have
increasing jaundice and altered mental status.  Liver
function tests at that time indicated an alkaline phosphatase
of 1091 and total bilirubin of 11.4.  His transaminases were
only slightly elevated.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound
was performed which indicated a dilatation of the common bile
duct as well as the presence of biliary sludge.  There was no
intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation and no gallstones.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed
after consultation with the gastroenterology service.  This
study indicated a fifteen millimeter common bile duct which
was stented as well as stenosis of the distal bulb.  The
patient's liver function tests, jaundice and mental status
improved following endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.  The patient was to have a
follow-up endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in
three months for stent removal.

Although the patient's mental status did improve following
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, some residual
symptoms of agitation and paranoia prompted a psychiatry
consultation who recommended low dose of Haldol p.r.n. for
worsening of these symptoms.  However, the patient's mental
status slowly returned to his baseline.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service who
found that he would benefit from acute rehabilitation.  At
the time of this discharge summary, the patient was being
screened for placement in an acute rehabilitation facility.

Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-3-16**] Coronary artery bypass graft x3 (left internal mammary
artery > left anterior descending, Saphenous vein graft > obtuse
marginal, saphenous vein graft > posterior descending artery)
and aortic valve replacement ( 25 mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] tissue valve)
[**2114-3-12**] Cardiac catherization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81021**] is a 76 year old male who presented to outside
hospital on [**3-8**] for revision of left hip prosthesis and
underwent surgery. He was doing well post-operatively, ambulated
with physical therapy today without symptoms, however when he
returned to bed he developed crushing substernal chest pain with
radiation to bilateral arms and the back of his neck. He had
never experienced pain like this before. It was associated with
shortness of breath and diaphoresis. He did not have nausea. He
was treated with nitro paste, morphine, aspirin, and IV
metoprolol. He believes the morphine relieved the chest pain.
CXR reportedly showed pulmonary vascular congestion. Labs
returned with CK 771, Trop 3.63, Hct 27.7. He has been pain free
since the original episode aside from a 20 second period of
shortness of breath which occurred at 4PM and resolved on its
own. He is transferred for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred from [**Hospital6 **] after ruling in
for non ST elevation myocardial infarction.  He was found to
have epitaxis with integrilin and ENT was consulted, nose was
packed and no further occurence with intergrilin stopping.  Was
also noted to have hematoma at left hip and orthopedic surgery
was consulted, it remained stable, required no surgical
intervention and no evidence of sciatic nerve dysfunction. He
underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated extensive
three vessel disease as well as aortic stenosis. He underwent
surgical evaluation for cardiac surgery.  On [**2114-3-16**] he was
brought to the operating room and underwent coronary artery
bypass graft surgery and aortic valve replacement.  See
operative report for further details.  He received vancomycin
for perioperative antibiotics.  He was transferred to the
intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.  He required
inotropes due to systolic heart failure but were weaned off in
the first twenty four hours postoperatively.  He was also weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated.
He remained in the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
monitoring, and had atrial fibrillation post operative day one
at night, treated with betablockers and amidarone which after a
few hours converted to normal sinus rhythm.  He was transferred
to the floor for the remainder of his care.  He had intermittent
episodes of atrial fibrillation and was started on coumadin for
anticoagulation.  On post-operative day three he was found to
have a right forearm phlebitis.  Further, there was a small
amount of sero-sanguinous drainage from his mediastinal
incision.  He was placed on Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.  On
the following day the sternal drainage abated.  The forearm had
improved, but because Mr. [**Known lastname 81021**] has a new aortic valve, a
PICC was placed and a plan was set for 2 weeks of IV Vancomycin
and oral ciprofloxacin.  Vanco troughs should accordlingly be
followd along with the progress of these wounds.  On the
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  He
continued to progress and was ready for discharge to rehab on
post operative day four.

Radiology:
UGI with SBFT [**2113-3-13**]: IMPRESSION: Status post total gastrectomy
with patent esophagojejunal anastomosis with no evidence of
leak.

KUB [**2113-3-16**]: IMPRESSION: No colonic distention. No obstruction.

CT abd/pelvis [**2113-3-17**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Complex collection, containing air, fluid, and
hyperattenuating material adjacent to the gastrojejunal
anastomosis, highly concerning for a leak.
2. Ascites.
3. Diffusely hypattenuated left lobe of liver (?post surgical)
with focal
indeterminate lesion in the left lobe of the liver. Suggest
follow with
ultrasound.
4. Right colon wall thickening, compatible with given history of
C. diff
colitis.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.

CXR [**3-20**]:
FINDINGS: Pigtail pleural catheter remains in place overlying
the lower
mediastinum, reportedly placed adjacent to esophagojejunal
anastomotic staples on CT interventional procedure of [**2113-3-17**]. The position appears slightly different than on the prior
chest radiograph of [**2113-3-18**], but tip of the catheter
continues to overlie a rounded gas collection. Large right
pleural effusion appears increased compared to the prior
examination, but a small left pleural effusion is not
substantially changed. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but
there is no evidence of congestive heart failure.

RUQ US [**3-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Gallbladder contains sludge but otherwise is without specific
signs of
cholecystitis, although this study does not exclude
cholecystitis. Sludge may not be unexpected in this patient who
has been fasting.
2. Complex collection surrounding the liver is as seen on recent
CT and
likely represents subhepatic hematoma.
3. Examination of the liver is slightly limited; however, no
focal lesion is seen to correspond with area of hypoattenuation
seen on CT in segment II of the liver.

RUE U/S [**3-22**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
Thrombosis of
radial vein.

Barium Swallow [**3-28**]:
IMPRESSION: Status post total gastrectomy with esophageal
jejunal anastomosis without evidence for leak at the anastomotic
site. Free flow of contrast through the anastomosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 43417**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for her elective surgery.
She tolerated the procedure well and recovered without acute
events in the PACU before being transferred to the floor. An
NGT, Foley, and JP drain were placed in the OR.

Chronological Events:
On [**3-10**] the patient was found to be hypotensive and was
transferred to the ICU for more acute managment. The following
events took place:

[**3-10**]: decreased responsiveness, SBP 70s, O2sat 60-70s on NRB ->
code blue, intubated, fem line placed, transfused 3UPRBC for Hct
20, bolused 1.5L for low UOP, epidural d/c'd
[**3-11**]: extubated, started 1/2 strength J-tube TF, [**Month (only) **] LR to 75,
started Synthroid, d/c'd fem line, started IV metoprolol
[**3-12**]: d/c'd NGT, started Roxicet, metoprolol per JT

The patient was transferred back to floor on [**3-12**] in stable
condition. An UGI study was performed that did not demonstrate
an anastomotic leak and she was started on a clear liquid diet.
Her TFs were continued.

on [**3-14**] she began to have several loose BMs and she was found to
be Cdiff positive. Vancomycin via her jtube was started. Her WBC
began to rise and she spiked a fever on [**3-15**]. She was found to
be more distended and had emesis. On [**3-17**] A CT abd/pelvis was
obtained and she was found to have an anastomotic leak. Thus,
she was sent to IR for placement of a catheter drain. This was
placed into her mediastinal fluid collection. She was also
started on IV vanco/zosyn and continued her treatment for
C.diff. She was made NPO.

On [**3-17**] she was started on fluconazole because her fluid
collection grew yeast.
On [**3-20**] a PICC line was placed.
On [**3-22**] she was found to have elevated LFTs and a RUQ u/s was
obtained. It was within normal limits, and her LFTs trended down
to normal within 2 days.
On [**3-22**] she was started on levaquin which continued through
discharge
On [**3-25**] she was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs. A geriatric consult
was initiated and she was started on Celexa and ritalin for
depression. Her depression mildly improved prior to discharge.
on [**3-26**] her tube feeds were changed to a more concentrated
formula to help correct her mild hyponatremia.
on [**3-28**] she had a repeat UGI study showing no leak. She was
started on a sips diet.
on [**3-29**] she started clear liquids
on [**3-30**] she started and tolerated a softs diet
On [**3-31**] she was discharged to a rehab facility. her picc line
was removed prior to discharge.

Physical Therapy worked with the patient daily, however she was
very reluctant to cooperate. Often, she refused to work with
them. PT did feel that she was capable of working with her
physically, but her reluctance limited her activity.

UTI/Urinary Incontinence/Urgency: The patient was often
incontinent to urine secondary to increased urgency. She was
treated for a UTI with cefepime and then levaquin. She was also
continued on detrol. A foley catheter was intermittently placed
to help her deal with her incontinence.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P; 85 y/o female with DM, HTN, known liver masses, pancreatic
mass, admitted with altered mental status, tachycardia, and
possible GI bleed.

1. Sepsis: The patient was transferred to the ICU [**2-6**] after
developing fluid-refractory hypotension on the floor and an
increasing oxygen requirement.  Her urine output had been
dropping off prior to transfer and was minimal after transfer.
Her albumin was 1.5 and she third spaced most of the volume.
She ultimately required four pressors to maintain her BP as well
as stress steroids.  The source of sepsis was unclear, but
likely a urinary or GI source.  Final read of CT abdomen
demostrated SBO.  She developed fulminant liver failure, DIC and
hemolytic anemia. She was intubated for resp distress and became
increasingly hypoxic, likely related to effusions and ascites.
The patient was made CMO by her family and expired at 3:05 pm on
[**2144-2-8**].
.
2. Altered MS: meningitis by CSF studies at OSH. Gram stain and
culture negative, but continued on empiric treatment.  MS
improved until MICU transfer (see 1).
.
3. Abdominal cancer: unclear primary. Initially thought to be
HCC, but AFP was low. Mass at porta hepatis extending from liver
to pancreas therefore pancreatic AC vs. cholangiocarcinoma vs.
other.  Had extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric
lymphadenopathy. The family decided against further work up and
treatment.
.
4. ARF/Hydronephrosis: right hydro seen on initial CT scan and
urology thought not to intervene unless creatinine worsened.
Resolved on subsequent CT scan. Patient became anuric at
transfer to ICU. Renal team following, and thought patient would
require CVVH, but family opted for CMO.
.
5. GIB: Hematocrit followed, guaiac positive through
hospitalization. GI consulted and wanted ID situation stabilized
then would consider endoscopy.  Her HCT remained stable after
initial 2 u prbc transfusions until she developed hemolytic
anemia related to sepsis.
.
6. Atrial fibrillation: intermittent periods of atrial
fibrillation, some with associated hypotension. Initially
responded to IV diltiazem.  Had AF with RVR in setting of
sepsis, was cardioverted and put on amiodarone.

CT head [**2141-4-12**]
Hypodensity in the right parietal lobe consistent with acute
infarct. Left
occipito-temporal lobe hypodensity c/w chronic infarct.

TTE [**2141-4-13**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

MRI brain, MRA head/neck [**2141-4-13**]
1. Moderately-sized biparietal acute/subacute infarcts.
2. Laminar necrosis and post-ischemic encephalomalacia
associated with the
old left occipital infarct.
3. Mild intracranial atherosclerotic disease without high-grade
stenosis or
vascular malformation.
4. There appears to be moderate to high-grade narrowing at the
origin of the
right internal carotid artery, with further quantification
limited on this
examination. Correlation with son[**Name (NI) 493**] and/or CTA findings is
suggested.

CTA head/neck [**4-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral cerebral infarcts in the parietotemporal region
without acute
hemorrhage. Unchanged appearance since the previous MRI.
2. 30-40% stenosis at the origin of right internal carotid
artery. This
stenosis is mild in nature. Otherwise patent arteries in the
neck. Direct
origin of the left vertebral artery from aorta a variation.
3. CT angiography of the head demonstrates diminished vascular
structures in
the infarcts. Otherwise tortuous arterial structures are seen
without
occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm.
4. Right parapharyngeal mass as seen on the previous studies.

Chest X ray [**4-17**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-12**] through 12:

The head and chin obscure much of the upper mid chest. Patient
could not be
positioned in any other fashion.

Previous pulmonary edema has not recurred. Bibasilar atelectasis
is
relatively mild. Small bilateral pleural effusions are new or
newly apparent.
Heart size is top normal. Feeding tube has been removed. Right
jugular line
tip projects over the upper right atrium. Heart size top normal.


A new left PIC line extends to the right of midline probably
into the right
subclavian vein. No pneumothorax is seen along the unencumbered
pleural
surfaces.

CXR [**4-20**]
FINDINGS: The course of the Dobbhoff catheter is unremarkable.
The catheter
is coiled in the proximal parts of the stomach. The tip projects
over the
proximal part of the stomach. On the displayed parts of the
thorax there is
no evidence of visible complications.

CXR [**4-23**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff
catheter has
been replaced by a nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube appears
to project
over the distal parts of the stomach. However, the tube is
coiled in the
stomach. Normal course of the tube, no evidence of
complications. Otherwise,
the radiograph is unchanged.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 78102**] is an 84-year-old man with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM and previous stroke who
presents with changes in mental status and evidence of new
stroke. Patient has new head CT with signs of acute RMCA stroke,
now bilateral disease.  In the initial evaluation, the patient
was very confused and disoriented, and concerning for possible
non-convulsive status epilepticus.  He received Ativan 1 mg IV
and had a further deterioration of his mental status.  The
patient was then intubated for airway protection and admitted to
the neuro ICU.
.
Hospital course by problem;
.
Neuro; The patient was admitted to the neurological ICU after
intubation in the Emergency Department.  His home aspirin was
discontinued and he was started on plavix.  Given his
disorientation and somnolence, he was initially started on
keppra, however this was discontinued the following morning as
his bilateral hemispheric disease from strokes were thought to
account for his change in mental status.   His blood pressure
was allowed to autoregulate for the first 48 hours after the
event.  A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no cardiac source
for his stroke.  The patient's LDL was 74 and HbA1c was 5.6.  He
was continued on a statin and fingersticks were covered with
regular insulin sliding scale.  He underwent an MRI brain and
MRA of his head and neck.  The MRI brain confirmed the right
parietal subacute infarct, however also appeared suspicious for
possible acute infarct in the left parietal lobe in the region
of his prior stroke in [**2139**], as this region was also bright on
DWI and dark on ADC.  This remains somewhat uncertain as the
area of infarct appears unchanged when comparing to his imaging
in [**2139**], although MRI sequences do reveal the concern for
possible bilateral acute strokes.  An MRA of the head and neck
was notable for moderate to high-grade narrowing at the origin
of the right ICA, although degree of stenosis was difficult to
quantify.  Therefore, the patient underwent CTA head and neck
which showed 30-40% stenosis at the origin of right internal
carotid artery, which was considered mild , and it did not show
evidence of any other abnormality. A transesophageal
echocardiogram was attempted which could not be completed owing
to parapharyngeal mass. His examination is notable for
inattention, fluent empty non meaningful speech, moving all
extermities antigravity.
.
Respiratory; The patient was extubated on HD#2 after receiving
his MRI/A. he was maintaining good saturation on oxygen mask
after transfer from ICU to floor.
.
ID; The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection on
[**4-17**] and was started on ciprofloxacin.  A urine culture was
sterile. He was given cipro for 7 days.
.
CV; The patient was continued on his beta blocker at 1/4 his
home dose to allow for permissive hypertension in the acute
setting of stroke and as he was bradycardic on telemetry with a
heart rate in the 50s-60s.  This can be titrated up to his home
dose of atenolol 100 mg daily as tolerated. He was in atrial
fibrillation, with controlled rate. Heparin or coumadin was not
started immdiately because of concerns for hemorrhagic
transformation. he was started on his home meds in stepwise
fashion keeping a watch over his blood pressure.
.
GU; The patient had hematuria upon arrival to the ICU.  This was
thought to be secondary to traumatic foley placement.  This
responded to irrigation and his hematocrit remained relatively
stable.
.
Endo; The patient was continued on his glipizide and
fingersticks were treated with regular insulin sliding scale.

ENT; patient was noted to have parapharyngeal mass for which ENT
consult was sought. They felt that this does not require urgent
work up and does not pose contraindication for anticoagulation,
should felt necessary for other reasons.

Nutrition
He was evaluated by nutrition team. he was encouraged to
increase PO intake and to undergo calorie count. It was felt
that he would require PEG tube. He got PEG tube on [**4-25**], and
feeds were started.
.
Goals of care; Unfortunately, the patient's wife passed away one
year ago and he has no known family.  His health care proxy is
his sister-in-law, [**Name (NI) 78103**] [**Name (NI) 27598**].  She was frequently contact[**Name (NI) **] and
the goals of care were discussed on regular basis. It was
decided to continue the care in extended care facility.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was found down.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old white male
with a past medical history of seizure disorder on Tegretol and
mental retardation among others.  The patient was found down at
home today by EMS.  Per the patient's brother, the patient lives
alone and the family periodically ""checks in with him"".  No one
has heard from the patient for three days so the EMS broke the
door down.  The patient was found down unconscious, covered in
emesis as well as blood (question nosebleed).  The patient was
noted to have multiple abrasions over his body.

Little is known about the patient's other history.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 336**] last week with a change in mental status. His
mental status there was described as awake, alert, but minimally
attentive.  His course was complicated by an upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed
severe erosive esophagitis, question of [**Female First Name (un) 564**], and small
gastric polyps.  The patient was discharged on Fluconazole,
Tegretol, Prilosec, and Loperamide.

Apparently, the patient's father died on [**Holiday 1451**] one year
ago and the patient was depressed related to this.  Many empty
pill bottles were found next to him.

The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department where his GCS was 6 with oxygen saturation
in the 80s.  The patient was intubated.  He was hemodynamically
stable with blood pressure in the 120s and heart rate in the 90s.
Left groin line was placed.  Chest x-ray showed a right lower
lobe pneumonia and bilateral apical opacities.  CT of the head
was negative.  CT of the spine was negative for any cervical
spine fractures.  The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mental retardation.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Seizure disorder secondary to meningitis as a child.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Fecal incontinence.
6.  Recent upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to erosive
esophagitis.
7.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2094**].
8.  Atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Tegretol.
2.  Pravachol.
3.  Atenolol.
4.  Zantac.
5.  Fluconazole

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non contributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies alcohol or tobacco use. He
lives alone in an apartment in [**Hospital1 8**], [**State 350**] and is
able to care for himself.  Once awake, he described how he takes
the subway to see his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 102851**], at [**Hospital 14852**], and described how he gets there.  He also
reports that he walks to the grocery store and buys his own
groceries.  He keeps in close contact with a social worker, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 12130**], that works in his building.  His brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 13304**],
lives in [**Name (NI) 3844**] and checks in with the patient
periodically.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure of
90/45, temperature maximum 102.4, heart rate 96 to 110,
respiratory rate 16 to 21, oxygen saturation 95 to 98% on
""many"" liters of oxygen.  General - The patient is not responsive
but moving in athetotic pattern.  Skin - multiple abrasions on
bilateral lower extremities (DIP of all toes, lateral malleoli
and dorsum of feet).  No petechiae.  No jaundice.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat examination - The pupils are 2.0
millimeters and reactive bilaterally. Unable to assess
extraocular movements.  Bilateral periorbital erythema and edema.
Right eye with subconjunctival hemorrhage superior to pupil.  No
Battle sign.  Respiratory is clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Examination limited due to the patient's unresponsiveness.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen is soft, normoactive bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended, no organomegaly.  Extremities - no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema, pulses 2+ bilaterally. Abrasions on lateral
malleoli bilaterally and dorsum of feet. Rectal is guaiac
negative.  Neurologically, the patient is moving all four
extremities, withdraws to pain, no posturing, no corneal or gag
reflex (but on Propofol).  Toes downgoing.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 17.6, hematocrit
34.3, platelets 364,000, neutrophils 71%, bands 18%, lymphocytes
6%.  Urinalysis is nitrite positive, protein trace, bilirubin
small, pH 5.0, blood negative, red blood cells 0 per high power
field, white blood cells 0-2 per high power field, bacteria rare.
Chem7 revealed sodium 141, potassium 4.4, chloride 105,
bicarbonate 13, blood urea nitrogen 56, creatinine 4.2, glucose
100, anion gap 23.  CPK [**Numeric Identifier 40281**], MB 91, index 0.8.  Toxicology
screen - Aspirin negative, ETOH negative, Tylenol negative,
benzodiazepines negative, barbiturates negative, TCAs negative.
Carbamazepine 33 ([**3-18**]).

Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR interval
204 consistent with first degree AV block, left atrial
enlargement, QRS 140, Q-Tc 450, peaked T waves, 1.0 to 2.[**Street Address(2) 27948**] elevation in V1, V2, but pattern is left bundle
branch block, no T wave inversions, Q wave only in lead III.

IMAGING STUDIES:  CT of the head revealed cerebellar atrophy,
mucosal thickening of maxillary and ethmoid sinus.  CT spine
revealed normal alignment of vertebra, no fractures, no
subluxation, positive degenerative changes in C4-C5, C5-C6,
C6-C7.  Chest x-ray revealed hazy opacities in the bilateral
apices and right lower lobe - ? aspiration.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Toxicology - The patient was noted to have elevated
Carbamazepine levels.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from toxicology
recommended charcoal for absorption of the toxin. Carbamazepine
levels were monitored q3hours.  Activated charcoal 30 grams were
given at the time of arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
and three hours afterwards and need for further doses was
evaluated in the a.m. after admission.  The patient most likely
had a Carbamazepine overdose (question intentional or confused
or due to interaction with fluconazole, recently begun for
candidiasis). The levels were reduced to therapeutic range with
charcoal treatment and intravenous hydration.  They were
monitored for a couple days after that, however, remained in
normal limits for the duration of the hospital course.

2.  Cardiology - The patient had a new widening of the QRS on
initial electrocardiogram and this was likely related to sodium
channel blocking activity of Tegretol.  One amp of bicarbonate
was pushed and the electrocardiogram was rechecked.  QRS
prolongation resolved rapidly after the bicarbonate and
resolution of the patient's acidemia.

3.  Pulmonary - Due to the patient's findings on chest x-ray
of right lower lobe and bilateral apical opacities, he was
assumed to have suffered an aspiration event causing aspiration
pneumonia.  He was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg intravenously
q.d. and Clindamycin 300 mg t.i.d. intravenously which was
continued for fourteen days.  While in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, he was kept on the ventilator with full support, however,
once he improved, on [**2100-11-8**], he was extubated.  No
complications after extubation.  The Levofloxacin and Clindamycin
were continued for a fourteen day course and discontinued
starting on [**2100-11-17**].  The patient's lung findings improved
rapidly over the course of the stay and for the last six days he
was clear to auscultation bilaterally with normal oxygen
saturation and no signs or symptoms, i.e., cough.

4.  Renal - Initially the patient's creatinine was increased to
4.2.  He also had elevated creatinine kinase enzyme levels around
10,000.  This was most likely rhabdomyolysis and resolved with
hydration and bicarbonate and eventually the CKs trended
downward.  The elevated creatinine normalized within the first
couple of days around [**2100-11-4**], and was postulated to be due to
acute renal failure secondary to severe hydration.  His decreased
potassium was also suspected to be secondary to diarrhea,
gastrointestinal losses.

5.  Gastrointestinal - His recent gastrointestinal bleed at [**Hospital 14852**] secondary to erosive esophagitis prompted
nasogastric tube lavage on admission in the Emergency Department
which was clear.  He was treated with intravenous Protonix for
the duration of his hospital course up until discharge.  Multiple
Clostridium difficile toxin assays were sent which were negative.
His abdominal examination continued to appear benign.

6.  Neurology - The patient's altered mental status was likely
secondary to the Tegretol overdose.  His CT of the head was
negative for any acute process.  Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for
HSV and urine toxicology screens were negative, not consistent
with these as possible etiologies of altered mental status.  The
patient was also while intubated on Propofol and thus not
allowing assessment of his current mental status.  A few days
later, a CT was done of the head again which showed minimal
intraventricular and subarachnoid blood.

Neurology recommendations included electroencephalogram and
magnetic resonance scan to further workup altered mental status.
Two lumbar punctures were also done, one at admission and one
later on.  Both were bloody with increased protein, however, CT
of the head initially did not reveal an acute bleed.  The repeat
CT on [**2100-11-4**], is stated above. Neurology did not feel that
these were large enough to be treated and thus would resolve on
their own.  Follow-up CT will need to be obtained one week after
discharge.

7.  Hematology - The patient's hematocrit was 34.3 on admission
and dropped to 26.7 on hospital day number one.  He was
transfused with two units after which his hematocrit remained
stable for the duration of the admission.

8.  Trauma - He was seen by trauma surgery to be evaluated for
cervical spine instability; they recommended that he be kept in a
cervical collar even though he had no fracture, since ligamentous
injury was not ruled out at the time. Later on in the course of
the hospitalization when he was moved to the floor, flexion and
extension spine films were done and approved by neurosurgery as
clear and thus the collar was removed.  He will follow-up with
neurosurgery a week or two after discharge when he will be
reevaluated with flexion and extension films as well as a head CT
to follow his subarachnoid blood and intraventricular blood seen
on CT of the head on [**2100-11-4**].

9.  Dermatology - The patient was also seen by dermatology while
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for his multiple abrasions on
bilateral malleoli and forehead.  Initially, it was felt that
these may be trauma induced erosions versus herpetic erosions.
DFA for HSV type I and type II as well as ZBZ were negative
except for an HSV type I DFA which was positive.  All other
cultures of the wound were negative and Acyclovir, which was
started empirically when dermatology first saw him for HSV, was
discontinued when these cultures and DFA came back negative.
These abrasions were treated with Bacitracin Ointment and wound
dressing changes b.i.d.

10. Psychiatry - While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient was also seen by psychiatry who was unable to fully
evaluate him while he was sedated.  They recommended an
electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance scan to evaluate
mental status if this did not improve once he was extubated.
They also were questioning the fact that his Carbamazepine
level of 33 implied overingestion, suggesting possible assault or
possible suicide attempt.  The hypothesis that was generated was
that perhaps the patient had a seizure and overdosed with
Tegretol during postictal confusion.

Later on in the hospitalization, they revisited the patient when
he was alert, awake and oriented.  The patient disclosed that he
had had a seizure on the day of admission.  He did not know
anything about the overingestion of the Tegretol, however, he did
deny assault or suicidal attempts.  At the time of discharge, the
patient was not considered to have any psychiatric issues as he
was cheerful and responsive to questions.  The psychiatry team
felt that it was reasonable that he was going to be discharged to
a temporary rehabilitation facility prior to returning home to
care for himself.

11. Hospital floor course - The patient was extubated on
[**2100-11-8**], and moved to the floor on [**2100-11-9**]. His respiratory
status was stable and oxygen was in the process of being weaned.
His issues of Tegretol overdose as well as rhabdomyolysis were
resolved and levels of Tegretol as well as CKs were trending
downward towards normal limits.

As aspiration pneumonia continued to be treated with Levofloxacin
and Clindamycin for a fourteen day course.  The patient continued
to improve respiratory wise with good oxygen saturation, good
respiratory rate and clear lung examination.

Neurology: he had a repeat head CT done on the day of transfer
from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor which was not
different from the [**2100-11-4**] study and was notable for perhaps a
slightly larger bleed (""subdural fluid collection"").  It was
decided that a repeat CT would be done one to two weeks after
discharge when following up with neurosurgery unless there was
significant clinical deterioration.  During his continued
hospital course, he had no neurological deficits, no signs of
central nervous system infection.  Magnetic resonance scan and
electroencephalogram were postponed as the patient's mental
status continued to improve progressively and once he was awake,
was alert and oriented times three.

Eventually as stated previously, his cervical collar was removed
once he was clinically cleared with extension and flexion
cervical spine films.

He was continued on Lopresor 100 mg b.i.d. for his hypertension
and was switched to Atenolol 100 mg q.d. on discharge.

Nutrition - The patient had a nasogastric tube in since the
Medical Intensive Care Unit stay and due to aspiration pneumonia
history as well as neck instability, tube feeds were started on
this patient two days after he reached the floor in efforts to
give him nutrition.  Swallow specialist was consulted.  For the
first couple of days, he failed the swallow studies with signs
and symptoms of aspiration upon taking thin liquids. Eventually,
he did better with liquids and was started on soft solids and
thick liquids. This continued to be his diet upon discharge.  He
remains on aspiration precautions.

His hematocrit remained stable during his hospital floor course
and his abrasions on his extremities continued to be treated with
Bacitracin Ointment application to the wounds with dressing
changes twice a day.

Of note, the patient's brother visited him once during his
Medical Intensive Care Unit stay at which time he was unable to
talk to the patient.  His brother visited one more time while he
was on the floor.  He described the patient was slowly returning
to his baseline and at baseline the patient talks and is fully
functional, transports himself around the city, and is very
meticulous about his medication regimen by taking the right
amount at the right time, never over or under.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/p: [**Age over 90 **] yo M

1. GI Bleed: patient with mult episodes of BRBPR.  Likely from
lower source given that Hct slowly going down.  Has remained
hemodynamically stable in ED.   No reoccurrence of GI bleed in
past 3 days. Location of bleed is yet to be determined. Bleeding
test was negative.  Continue to monitor for any changes.
Colonoscopy is necessary to determine location, as per GI. HCT
has been running in 27-29 for the past  days. It has been stable
but it low. Lab results today show that crit has decreased to
27.6. A unit of blood is necessary as the crit has dropped.
Discussed patient with GI. GI is following patient. Feel that he
is stable at the moment. [**Name2 (NI) **] plan from them. ON [**8-9**], crit had
increased to over 30. Still awaiting decision if f/u colonoscopy
is warranted given pt HX with the prep. Pt was given senna and
had 200 cc melena over night on [**8-12**]. Pt had not had bowel
movement since GI prep; this could just be residual blood from
initial GIB/. Repeat colonoscopy was decided against due to pts
present state

.
2. Delirium: Pt has remained in a confused state  for the past 4
days. He has been placed in restraints due to threatening
behavior and trying to pull at tubes. MS change has been
improving. He remains confused. He is responsive to voice and
tactile stimulation. Pt is mumbling but beginning to make more
sense. Concern remains what MS change is due to. Infectious work
up is in process. Began pt on olanzapine as per geriatric
consult. Pt had a run of SVT over the night on [**8-7**] but was
easily arousable. NO concern felt. ON [**8-8**], pt was conversing.
He appeared to be returning to his original state. Foley was d/c
and ucx and BCX taken. ucx was negative. UA obtained showed some
bacteria and WBC. That evening, Foley replaced due to lack of
output. Pt became combative and was given olanzapine. On rounds
on [**8-9**], pt unarousable. Tried to arouse him with multiple
stimuli with little response.  Suction was used to remove sputum
and fluid accumulating in his throat and mouth. Pt was
responsive to this measure. His eyes would bunch up and he tried
to block the suction.   His blood pressure decreased to 90/60.
But then returned between 118-120 and then increased to 130/85.
CXR showed Left retrocardiac opacity. Pt afternoon, pt
responsive and more alert. D/c haldol and olanzapine. If
combative, pt will be placed in restraints. Trying to have
patient come off the past medications. On [**8-9**], began Levaquin
due to CXR showing possible aspiration pneumonia and a possible
UTI as shown by UA. These are both possible causes for patients
current state. Marked improvement noted on [**8-10**]. Pt became more
responsive and was able to tell the story of how he ended up in
the hospital. SPS consulted again for evaluation. Vanco was d/c
as blood CX on [**8-3**] showed that bacteria was susceptible to
oxacillin.
-Bacteremia seems to be the cause of the delirium

Pt given trazodone and lodaxaprine on the night of [**8-10**]. The
following morning, pt arousable but became agitated. Mitt
restraints initiated to stop patient from pulling foley. Pt
continues to wax and wane in his knowledge of place and time.
The AM of [**8-12**], pt was conversive and alert to his location. He
then proceeded to begin pulling on his IV and trying to removed
bandages. Pt continues to have bouts of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]. He
alert to people but confused over who people are and various
events that are occurring.
.
3. HTN: Hydralazine
- if pt becomes re-oriented, possibly return to Univasc 15mg PO
daily. On [**8-13**],  began Univasc as replacement for hydralazine.

4.PPX: pneumonic boots have been placed on patient since initial
changes. Request for patient to be repositioned q2h to avoid
pressure ulcers.

5. FEN: Pt begun on D5W upon admission. When MS change,
continued on D5W. On [**8-9**], begun on D5 [**12-28**] N. SPS consulted and
found pt should remain NPO. Decision made to check the next day
for alertness. If pt remains alert and partially oriented, SPS
will be re consulted. if not, NG tube and nutrition consult will
be obtained. SPS reevaluated patient on [**8-11**] and determined that
soft foods are acceptable. Recommended a video swallow which
showed that ground food was acceptable. Switched all meds to PO
form to see how patient fairs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which was signficant for left main and severe three vessel
coronary artery disease. Angiography revealed a right dominant
system with 50% distal left main lesion; 70% ostial stenosis in
the left anterior descending; 90% stenosis in the circumflex
involving the first obtuse marginal; and 70% lesion in the mid
right coronary artery. Ventriculography showed only trace mitral
regurgitations with an LVEF around 50%. Based on the above
results, cardiac surgery was consulted and further evaluation
was performed. A preoperative chest x-ray was notable for a new
right lower lobe opacity which will require further evaluation
as an outpatient. Workup was otherwise unremarkable and he was
cleared for surgery.

On [**2174-9-29**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed three vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting. This operation was performed off pump. Surgery
was uneventful and he transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. He required diuresis and
aggressive chest PT while steroid therapy was resumed. Serial
chest x-rays were notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the left
hemithorax with a small left apical pneumothorax. He otherwise
maintained stable hemodynamics and eventually transferred to the
SDU. Steroid therapy was gradually tapered. He remained afebrile
but was empirically started on antibiotics for positive sputum
culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Postoperatively, he was
noted to have a persistent leukocytosis - most likely
steroid-induced. Beta blockade was slowly advanced as tolerated.
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm. At discharge, his apical
pneumothorax remained stable while oxygen saturations remained
96% on 3L. Over several days, he worked with physical therapy
and continued to make clinical improvements. Medical therapy was
optimized and he was eventually cleared for rehab on
postoperative day seven. He will need to complete his
antibiotics at rehab and continue to require several more days
of gentle diuresis. He will eventually need to follow up with
his pulmonologist and require outpatient CT scan to further
evaluate his new right lower lobe lung opacity.

.
EKG: NSR. No acute ST-T changes.
.
CXR: No acute process. Hyperinflation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a 83 yo F w/PMHx sx for cholangiocarcinoma with
malignant stricture admitted after biliary stent exchange with
postoperative hypoxia.
.
She initially complained of severe chest pain. A chest x-ray was
performed and did not show evidence of infection or fluid
overload. She had a normal EKG. Three sets of cardiac enzymes
were checked and were normal. Initially she was placed on
telemetry, given aspirin 325 mg, simvastatin 80 mg, and started
on metoprolol due to concern for an ischemic event in the
setting of ERCP. When her enzymes were negative, these were
discontinued.
.
Over the course of the next day, she was noted to have a
leukocytosis, and a fever, as well as hypoxia, concerning for an
aspiration event. She was started on levofloxacin and
metronidazole. Sputum and blood cultures were ordered. A speech
and swallow consult was placed and recommended thickened liquids
and ground solids, as well as 1:1 supervision with meals. Blood
cultures grew GPC in pairs and chains, and vancomycin was
started. Serial blood cultures were ordered and showed gram
negative rods.
.
She had chronic diastolic heart failure during her stay. She was
initially given a dose of 20 mg IV lasix for possible fluid
overload related to her ERCP, but was noted to be fairly
euvolumic with no evidnece of fluid overload on exam, and was
transitioned to lasix 40 mg twice daily per her home dose. She
had daily I/Os, daily weights. She was continued on aspirin, a
beta-blocker, and a statin, as well as lisinopril.
.
For her cholangiocarcinoma with malignant stricture, she is s/p
stent exchange. For her diabetes, her glipizide was held
inpatient, and she was continued on insulin sliding scale. She
was continued on her home medications for Parkinson's disease.

.
She was DNR/DNI during her stay, confirmed with her and her
husband.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] update:
In the morning of [**2168-9-20**] the hospitalist was called to assess
the patient for acute onset shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Per his note her SpO2 was initially 55% which improved to 75% on
a non-rebreather.  The patient was noted to be rigoring and
uncomfortable.  Of note the patient has parkinson's disease and
it was difficult to obtain an accurate finger oximetry. Her
blood pressure was measured at 230/60 and her respiratory rate
was 44. She received an albuterol nebulizer threatment and her
oxygen saturations improved to 98% on 4L NC but she remained
tachypneic in the 30s.  ABG performed during the trigger was
7.45/37/108.  Stat portable CXR was unchanged from priors.  She
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On review of systems she notes feeling chilled and continues to
have shortness of breath.  She denies fevers, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain
or swelling.  She has not had a recurrence of the chest pain she
experienced on the night of admission.

Patient underwent CTA which showed no evidence of PE on CT scan,
no evidence of pna. Presumed shortness of breath was thought to
be secondary to bacteremia - grew out gram negative rods in
blood which grew while on levofloxacin with increasing WBC, most
likely biliary stent is the etiology. TTE without evidence of
vegetations, c. diff pending.

Medicine Floor Transfer)

Patient subsequently transferred from ICU to the medical floor.
Her [**9-16**] blood cx grew VRE while her [**9-20**] blood cx grew two
colonies of e.coli resistant to ampicillin, flouroquinolones and
bactrim.  The patient was discharged to complete a 14 day total
course of linezolid and ceftriaxone.  Of note, patient with
allergy of rash to PCN.  Would monitor for any evidence of
allergic reaction.

STUDIES
EKG: aflutter variable block, and afib, tachy 112, irreg, NA, no
ST-T changes.
.
Studies:
[**11-21**]-CTA
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2.  Slight decrease in size of bilateral pleural effusions.
3.  Stable appearance of sub 4-mm pulmonary nodules in the right
lung. 4.  Calcified pleural plaques consistent with prior
asbestos exposure.
5.  Small hiatal hernia.

.
[**11-21**] CT Head
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

2.  Stable size and mild mass effect of mass lesions within the
left cerebral peduncle and posterior limb of the left internal
capsule. Increased internal hypoattenuation within these lesions
could represent interval necrosis.
.
Of note, if further evaluation of the known underlying mass
lesions is required, an [**Month/Year (2) 4338**] with gadolinium would be
recommended.

TTE [**2191-11-22**]:
Left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is  not present The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-1-28**],
there is rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation. The
biventricular function and valvular regurgitation are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo male with PMH of afib, high grade glioma who presented
with afib/flutter with RVR in the 150s, hemodynamically stable.

Cardiovascular)  Patient presented with atrial
flutter/fibrillation perhaps triggered by hypovolemia.
Initially admitted to the ICU overnight then transferred to the
medicine service the following day. No evidence of PE,
infection, ischemia, medication noncompliance, substance
use/withdrawal. The patient's lasix was held. Cardiac enzymes
were not elevated.  Patient received IV diltiazem with
resumption of his outpatient medication regimen with
short-acting form of diltiazem 60 mg po qid(on diltiazem SR 240
mg po qd as outpatient) and metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] with good rate
control throughout the rest of his admission.
   Since hypovolemia appeared to be a trigger for the patient's
a-fib with RVR and since he has poor po intake, on discharge the
patient's lasix was decreased from 40 mg po qd to 20 mg po qd.

Aspiration PNA- The patient's levaquin/flagyl for question of
aspiration pneumonia was completed on [**11-23**]

Thrombocytopenia-The patient had decreasing platelets since [**11-15**]
down to 89 on [**11-21**]. Keppra had been started on [**11-7**].  The
patient's keppra was changed to dilantin. HIT antibody came back
positive. Since there was now a clear explanation for the
patient's thrombocytopenia, the patient's keppra was restarted
and dilantin discontinued.

Glioma-The patient received 3 treatments of brain XRT on
consecutive days before discharge. The patient is to follow-up
at [**Hospital1 18**] radiation oncology clinic at [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] basement Monday
through Friday (5 days a week for 28 consecutive treatments) at
2:30 pm.  Rehab is to arrange transport for patient.

CVA- Hx of CVA-On aspirin, warfarin contraindicated due to
glioma.
.
FEN: Tubefeeds.  Speech and swallow evaluated the patient and
noted that he is a silent aspiration risk and instructed that
the patient not take any meds by mouth.  the patient receives
his meds via G-tube.  IR evaluated the patient's G-tube on day
of discharge and noted that it was in good working order and did
not need to be replaced.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension:  On admission, the idea that the patient had
evidence of sepsis given leukocytosis was considered.  Possible
sources included septic knee (with resulting bacteremia); less
evidence for pulmonary, GI, or GU.  Thought that hypovolemic,
cardiogenic, anaphylactic etiologies less likely.  PE a
possibility given ortho procedure this fall and prior clot
history but seems less likely as not hypoxic.  No evidence for
tamponade.  The patient was volume resuscitated, given empiric
vancomycin and ceftriaxone to cover for possible septic joint,
however knee films and ortho eval of right knee suggestive that
knee not nidus of infection.  Held home [**Last Name (un) **] and beta blocker.
Cardiac enzymes cycled.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely seccondary to
hypotension.  Improved with fluids.  Renally dosed meds and
avoid nephrotoxins, hold [**Last Name (un) **]

3. Anemia:  Patient likely hemoconcentrated at admission. No
active bleeding. Iron, B12, folate levels within normal limits
[**9-16**].  Followed hct daily, type +screen.  Patient did not
require a transfusion.

4. Chronic pain:  Continued home pain medications with holding
parameters

5. h/o chronic pancreatitis:  Continued pancreatic enzyme
replacement, pain meds as above

6. DM: Continued insulin, follow fingersticks goal <150

7. CAD:  Continued ASA, statin. Held [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of renal
failure and BB in setting of hypotension.

8. Crohn's disease: Continued mesalamine

9. CHF, chronic, diastolic: Held [**Last Name (un) **] and BB as above. Appeared
euvolemic on exam.

10. h/o EtoH abuse: Patient denied any recent drinking.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with hypotension (low blood pressure) and were
treated with pressors and fluids with resolution of your
symptoms. You were also given a short course of antibiotics. You
were monitored after the discontinuation of your antibiotics and
have done well. It is very important that you follow up with
your primary care physician for further monitoring. You should
also return to the ED if you develop a fever, night sweats,
shortness of breath or any symptoms that concern you. You should
also monitor your knee for any evidence of increased redness,
swelling or increased drainage from your wound.
.
Because you had decreased blood pressure your valsartan to 40 mg
daily. Your metoprolol has been changed to metoprolol tartrate
50mg twice daily. (Please ensure that your are taking metoprolol
TARTRATE 50mg twice daily and not metoprolol SUCCINATE - you
have had multiple prescriptions in the past by both names) You
should discuss these changes with your regular doctor.

Please return to the ED or call your regular doctor if you
experience fever, chills, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
knee pain that is worse, discharge or puss form your knee or any
other symptom that concerns you.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**]
Chief Complaint:
mechanical fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
60 yo M with EtOH abuse, MDS, diabetes mellitus, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, ?cirrhosis, presents with a fall down 15 stairs.
He was intoxicated with EtOH at the time, and also experienced
lightheadedness prior to falling. Additionally, the patient
complains of black/green vomiting and black stools for the past
3 days. He says that he vomiting 10 times and had [**4-27**] bowel
movements before coming to the hospital.
.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 1196**]
on [**2124-3-7**] for non-bloody nausea/vomiting, attributed to
gastroenteritis. His Hct was 35.9 on admission, which was above
his baseline of around 30. He was transfused 2 units PRBC during
that admission. His admission was complicated by urinary
retention requiring placement of a Foley catheter.
.
Of note, the patient takes ibuprofen 5-6 tabs/day. he has been
doing this for the past 2 months, to control pain from recent
zoster infection. He has a history of heavy EtOH use, but denies
drinking during the past 1.5 years, except for half a bottle of
brandy last night. He denies a history of upper endoscopy but
believe that he had a colonoscopy 5-7 years ago.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.4 84 179/89 16 100% RA. The
patient complained of back and shoulder pain. He had a single
episode of white emesis. Stool was brown and guaiac-positive.
Labs were notable for WBC 2.7, Hct 31.7, Plt 110, INR 1.0, Cr
0.8, ALT 43, EtOH 141, lactate 3.2 (downtrending to 2.9). CT of
the head and neck were negative for acute injuries. However, the
patient's C-spine could not be cleared due to pain to palpation
at C5-6, so he remained in a C-collar. CT abdomen/pelvis showed
massive splenomegaly, circumferential bladder wall thickening,
pancreatic calcifications, extensive colonic diverticulosis,
right renal cyst, no acute process. CXR showed no acute
cardiopulmonary process. Left shoulder films were negative for
fracture or dislocation. EKG NSR without ischemic changes.
.
In the ED, 16- and 18-gauge peripheral IVs were placed. The
patient was given 3 L NS, ativan 1 mg IV x 3, dilaudid 0.5 mg IV
x 1, zofran 4 mg IV x 2. He was bolused with 40 mg of IV
protonix, and started on a protonix gtt. NG lavage was not
performed. GI was consulted and recommended protonix and
octreotide gtt, anesthesia consult for EGD given C-collar. The
patient was admitted to the MICU due to concern about CIWA
scores as high as 30 ([**Doctor Last Name **] [**1-24**] on transfer). GI also
preferred to scope the patient in the ICU due to the present of
the C-collar. On transfer, the patient was afebrile with HR 84,
RR 20, BP 122/90, Sat 99%/RA.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient's only complaint was left
shoulder pain. He says he had some lightheadedness earlier which
has improved but is still present.
.
Review of systems: Denies fever, chills. +cough, sore throat
during past 3 days. No chest pain. No abdominal pain. +nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea. Denies dysuria. No rashes or skin changes.
No focal weakness. Chronic LE tingling/numbness. Denies
depression, anxiety, or SI.

         This organism may develop resistance to third

         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted

IMAGING STUDIES:
.
[**2124-3-28**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline
structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large vascular territorial
infarction. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is suggestive
of global volume loss. There is scattered mucosal thickening
throughout the bilateral ethmoidal air cells. Minimal mucosal
thickening is also seen in the right maxillary sinus. The
remainder of the visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses
are well aerated. Opacification of scattered posterior right
mastoid air cells is noted. The remainder of the mastoid air
cells are well aerated bilaterally. No fractures are seen.
.
[**2124-3-28**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - No acute process in the abdomen
or pelvis. Massive splenomegaly. Extensive colonic
diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis. Hyperdense
right renal cyst, likely hemorrhagic or proteinaceous however
Incompletely characterized. Coarse pancreatic calcifications,
possibly the sequelae of chronic pancreatitis. Circumferential
bladder wall thickening could relate to chronic outlet
Obstruction or cystitis.
.
[**2124-3-28**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST - No acute fracture. Minimal
anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 is likely degenerative.
.
[**2124-3-28**] CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) - Single supine portable view of the
chest. No prior. Lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.
.
[**2124-3-28**] GLENO-HUMERAL SHOULDER -  AP, Grashey and scapular Y
views of the left shoulder. No prior. There is no visualized
fracture. Glenohumeral joint is anatomically aligned. Mild
degenerative changes noted at the acromioclavicular joint.
Included left lung and ribs are unremarkable.


Brief Hospital Course:
# GI bleed: The patient presented with report of copious black
stools and emesis. History suggestive of upper GIB, particularly
in the setting of heavy NSAID use. The differential on admission
included gastritis/PUD, variceal bleeding in the setting of
possible cirrhosis, [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear. His hematocrit has been
stable at 28, and probably at patient's baseline, arguing
against large bleed. He was maintained NPO, two large bore IV's
were placed and a type and cross performed. The patient's
hematocrit was serially monitored. He was also maintained on an
Octreotide and Protonix infusion. EGD showed esophagitis and
possible [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  He was transitioned to omeprazole
[**Hospital1 **].  He will continue on omeprazole on discharge to rehab and
should have follow CBC in 2 days [**2124-4-2**].
.
# Fall: Patient presented having fallen down 15 steps with a
feeling of light-headedness preceeding. The fall was likely due
to alcohol intoxication from the [**1-24**] bottle of brandy that
patient drank prior to admission, and possibly orthostasis in
the setting of GI bleeding and vomiting with diarrhea. He had
back pain on presentation and had a CT-neck that showed no
fracture, but chronic degenerative changes. On exam, patient had
no neurologic deficits and had paraspinal neck tenderness with
other tenderness radiating to the left shoulder. He had no
tenderness at the midline. He was given a soft collar for
comfort for four weeks and discharged to follow-up with spine
center in four weeks.  Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8603**]
to set up a follow up appointment after discharge from rehab.
.
# Alcohol abuse: Per patient report, no current regular use
except the night prior to admission. However, there was concern
about alcohol withdrawal in the ED. A CIWA scale was enacated
and social work was consulted.  No signs of alcohol withdrawl
during hospitalization.  Patient counseled on importance of
absinence from alcohol.
.
# UTI: pt with no reported urinary symptoms, fevers, but urine
culture + klebsiella/enterobacter(sensitive to cipro).  He was
started on ciprofloxacin and will need a course for 14
days(complicated by foley).  The patient passed a voiding trial
and the foley was removed.
.
# DM2: His home insulin (lantus 45 daily lispro 8 tid w/meals)
were held as he was npo and a insulin sliding scale was used.
His sugars ranged from 120-200 with insulin sliding scale.  He
will be discharged with a insulin sliding scale and his home
regimen can be slowly restarted as his po intake improves.
.
# HTN: Unclear home regimen. Likely chronically runs high, but
BP is significantly elevated now. He was continued on amlodipine
and labetolol IV.  On discharge his amlodpine was 10mg.  If he
continues to be hypertensive than po labetolol can be added.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: stable this admission.
.
# Bipolar disorder: Patient is on numerous psych medications,
but it is unclear who is prescribing them or how regularly he

CT C-SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST: Images were obatined from the skull
base through T1. There is essentially normal alignment with mild
grade I anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and mild loss of
intervertebral disc space height at C6. There are no fractures
and no dislocation. Prevertebral soft tissues are normal. There
is no central canal stenosis.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation; minor degenerative
changes.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or evidence of acute infarction.
Hypoattenuation and encephalomalacia within the right parietal
and occipital lobe are unchanged and consistent with old
infarcts. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent
with age- related involutional changes. Osseous structures and
soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.

PORTABLE AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The heart size
remains enlarged, without evidence of pulmonary edema,
atelectasis or pneumonia. The lungs remain hyperinflated with
flattening of the diaphragms. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion is seen. A left axillary pacemaker is again seen, with
continuously transvenous right atrial pacer lead and right
ventricular pacer defibrillator lead in unchanged position. The
patient is status post CABG, with unchanged appearance to median
sternotomy wires. Calcifications are again noted along the
aortic arch.
IMPRESSION: Stable moderate cardiomegaly and hyperinflation,
without evidence of acute intrathoracic process.

There are no intracranial hemorrhages or masses. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white
matter
differentiation is maintained. Again seen is an old posterior
watershed
infarct of the right occipital lobe. There is a minimal amount
of
periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with
chronic
microangiopathic change.

The visualized orbits are normal. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear. Calcifications of the carotid
arteries are seen
bilaterally. There are no suspicious bony abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities. Old right
posterior
watershed infarct and minimal amount of chronic microangiopathic
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
69F h/o CAD s/p multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
25%), DM2, asthma here with hypoglycemia, ARF after fall.  She
was initially admitted to the ICU and then transferred to the
medicine floor.
.
1. Hypoglycemia
2. DM-2 Uncontrolled, with complications
Most likely etiology of hypoglycemia is from continuing to take
her baseline insulin in setting of acute renal insufficiency.
Also likely that she was getting more insulin than required as
she is not on steroids now and her dose was increased during her
last admission when she was on steroids.  No evidence of
infection.  She was given dextrose initially with improvement of
her blood sugar and mental status.  Her home insulin was held
and she was placed on an insulin sliding scale.  Patient
initially presented with hypoglycemic episode in setting of
increased insulin dose with some evidence of renal failure.
Started on Lantus during this admission, with dose titrated up
to 15 units.  Also kept on humalog sliding scale.  Fingersticks
were reasonably controlled on this regimen, however she did have
some values in the low 200s, and will need further monitoring
and adjusting of her dosage as an outpatient.
.
3. Acute Renal Failure
Likely in setting of volume depletion.  Admission FeUrea < 35%
in setting of decreased urine output.  Subsequently resolved
with hydration.  Lisinopril and Lasix had been held, now
restarted.  Cr continued to remain stable.
.
4. Heart Failure - chronic systolic and chronic diastolic
Last TTE showed EF of 25% w/ grade III diastolic dysfunction.
Did not appear volume overloaded.  O2 sats well maintained on
room air.  She was continued on Lasix, ACE-i, and B-blocker.
.
5. COPD - stable
Labelled as having asthma and previously denied heavy smoking
hx. However, last PFTs seemed more c/w emphysematous picture.
CXRs show large lung volumes and flattening of diaphragms. Also,
ABG shows evidence of chronic retainer. Has scattered wheezes.
She was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.  While on the
medical floor, she remained off oxygen with O2 sats in the mid-
to high-90s.  Given that she is a likely CO2 retainer, O2 sats
should not be kept high.
.
6. Coronary Artery Disease
Long/complex cardiac hx. Has had failed CABG in past. Currently
asymptomatic w/o chest pain/sob. Had troponin leak in setting of
demand and renal failure during this admission, however did not
have ACS.  She was continued on ASA 325, [**Doctor Last Name **], Statin, and
B-blocker
.
7. LUE DVT - catheter associated
Had been on Lovenox/Coumadin on discharge from previous
admission.  These were held on presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Was on
heparin gtt in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to initial concern for ACS picture.
This was subsequently stopped.  Plan had been to do one-month
course of anticoagulation for UE DVT.  However, given patient's
waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, tendency to pull out lines, recent
fall, and the fact that DVT was in the upper extremity, risk of
anticoagulation would likely outweigh any benefit.  She was
maintained on prophylactic SC Heparin.
.
8. Depression
Stable. Continued on Paxil
.
9. Altered Mental Status/Likely dementia w/ recent fall and
episode of being non-verbal
Do not suspect there has been an acute change in mental status.
Given vascular hx, would consider multi-infarct dementia (vs.
early Alzheimer's dementia) as possible etiology for overall
confusion.  Head CT did not show acute bleed or evidence of new
infarct.  On the day of transfer to the floor, the patient was
non-verbal.  She was able to follow commands, however seemed to
be more lethargic than usual and seemed unable to speak.  A
repeat head CT did not show any acute findings.  She
subsequently returned back to her baseline.  Given the overall
poor mental status over the past few months, the patient would
benefit from outpatient neuropsychological testing and possibly
further imaging of her head.
.
10. Question of Paroxysmal A-fib
Patient was generally in sinus rhythm at a well controlled rate
while in house.  However, per notes, has had episodes of A-fib
in the past.  Anticoagulation issue discussed as above.  Issue
of anticoagulation will have to be addressed as an outpatient.
She may benefit from an assessment of her disease burden (if
any) of the A-fib.
.
Disposition:
Patient failed at home given readmission.  PT consult
recommended rehab.  Discussed issue with patient's daughter,
[**Name (NI) 107611**].  [**Name2 (NI) 227**] strong family support and possibility of increased
services, along with family and patient's preference for patient
to go home, patient was discharged home with 24-hour
supervision.

.
It is very important that you follow your blood glucose level
very carefully and record these.  Your insulin was changed from
Insulin 75/25 twice daily to Insulin Glargine once daily (at
night) along with a sliding scale of insulin (Humalog) to be
given prior to meals.  You should check your fingerstick 30
minutes prior to meals and give the insulin based on this.  Keep
a log of these sugars and bring this to your doctor's visit.
.
You were on coumadin and Lovenox previously.  However, since you
had a fall and the blood clot you were being treated for was in
the upper part of your body, these medications have been stopped
since the risk of the medication is likely greater than the
likely benefit.
.
It is very important that you take in an adequate amount of
fluid, particularly water, so that you do not get dehydrated.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
female with type 1 renal tubular acidosis, history of
ischemic cardiomyopathy complicated by failure (with an
ejection fraction of 25%), coronary artery disease (status
post right coronary artery stent placement in [**2178-2-14**]),
and other comorbidities who presented with abdominal pain and
diarrhea times four days.

The patient is a poor historian.  She says that the pain is
dull, constant, and nonradiating, and is located below the
umbilicus.  Her diarrhea is nonbloody, and she denies black
or tarry stools.  She says she has also had some nausea and
shortness of breath over the past four days and recently
chills.  She denies the following; fevers, headaches, chest
pain, palpitations, flank pain, dysuria, change in urination
or frequency, arthralgias, or myalgias.  She also denies
recent changes in her medications or recent alcohol or drug
use.  Of note, she had an abdominal computed tomography
yesterday with intravenous contrast.  At that time, her blood
urea nitrogen was 49, and her creatinine was 4.5.

In the Emergency Department, she was started on normal saline
infusion at 75 mL per hour.  She also received one ampule of
glucose for a fingerstick blood glucose in the 60s.  Serum
electrolyte panel revealed her blood urea nitrogen was 59.
Her creatinine was 5.3 (her baseline is 20 to 30/1.1 to 1.3;
respectively).  This revealed hyponatremia and acidemia that
had been stable over the past one to two months.

Electrocardiogram revealed inferolateral ST-T wave changes
not seen on the last study from [**2178-2-14**]; which could be
consistent with myocardial ischemia.  Her cardiac enzymes
were not elevated on the first draw.  An abdominal computed
tomography revealed a pan-colitis.   A head computed
tomography was negative.

She was transferred to the floor for management of her
pan-colitis and acute renal failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 1 renal tubular acidosis; complicated by
hypokalemia, acidemia, and recently hyponatremia (126 to 128
in [**2178-6-16**]).  She is on a low-salt diet with a 1-liter
per day fluid restriction.
2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy complicated by congestive heart
failure diagnosed in [**2178-2-14**].  An echocardiogram at
that time revealed an ejection fraction of 25% with akinesis
of the inferior and basilar walls.  Since then, she has been
stable with [**State 531**] Heart Association class II symptoms.
3.  Coronary artery disease; cardiac catheterization in [**2178-2-14**] revealed a 100% occlusion of the right coronary
artery which was stented.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma.
5.  Anxiety and depression.
6.  Attention deficit disorder.
7.  Osteoporosis.
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

day for 25 years.  She denies alcohol use.  The patient is
single with no children and lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother died at the age of 67 with
cerebrovascular accident and also with coronary artery
disease.  Father died at the age of 40 from a motor vehicle
accident.  Sister has diabetes and breast cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.6
degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 113/60, her heart
rate was 88, her respiratory rate was 22, and her oxygen
saturation was 96% on room air.  In general, the patient was
shivering, lying in bed.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  No nystagmus.  The
oral mucosa was pink and slightly dry.  No lesions.  Neck
examination revealed a large soft tissue mass.  No
lymphadenopathy appreciated.  Chest examination revealed
coarse breath sounds bilaterally with decreased breath sounds
at the right base.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  A regular
rate and rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic murmur.  Abdominal
examination revealed hypoactive bowel sounds.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No organomegaly or
masses appreciated.  Guaiac-negative in the Emergency
Department.  Extremity examination revealed the lower
extremities were cool to touch.  Posterior tibialis pulse
were 1+ bilaterally.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  Sharp discrimination poor
over the upper and lower extremities bilaterally.  Oriented
to person and place but not to time.  Skin examination
revealed mild reaction of turgor over hand, small lesions
over body.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Admission
laboratory data revealed her white blood cell count was 8.7,
her hematocrit was 31.9, and her platelets were 202.  Her
sodium was 124, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 95,
bicarbonate was 13, blood urea nitrogen was 59, creatinine
was 5, and blood glucose was 166.  Prothrombin time was 13.3,
partial thromboplastin time was 26.1, and her INR was 1.3.
Her ALT was 5, AST was 16, alkaline phosphatase was 97, total
bilirubin was 0.3, amylase was 164, and her lipase was 66.
Albumin was 3.5.  Calcium was 8.2.  Lactate was 1.1.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram from [**7-31**] showed first-degree atrioventricular block, poor R wave
progression, inferolateral ST-T changes which may represent
myocardial ischemia.

An abdominal computed tomography with contrast on [**7-30**]
showed pan-colitis.

A head computed tomography from [**7-31**] showed no acute
pathological intracranial process.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  PAN-COLITIS ISSUES:  On admission, the patient was made
nothing by mouth.  Stool studies were sent.  Cultures for
Clostridium difficile, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter,
Yersinia, and ova and parasites all were negative.  She was
started on antibiotics with ciprofloxacin 200 mg
intravenously q.24h. and metronidazole 500 mg intravenously
q.8h.  She was also stool guaiaced which were all negative.

During the course of her hospitalization, she was switched to
a course of ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and
completed a 10-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl.

Gastroenterology saw the patient in consultation and agreed
with the plan to treat with antibiotics and recommended a
flexible sigmoidoscopy after resolution of her symptoms.

On [**8-11**], she had a repeat abdominal computed tomography
which showed resolution of her pan-colitis.  Throughout the
course of her hospital stay, her abdominal pain subsided; now
only intermittent and only with deep palpation.

 2.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES AND TYPE I RENAL TUBULAR
ACIDOSIS ISSUES:  Acute renal failure was presumed to be
predominantly prerenal and perhaps some component of acute
tubular necrosis secondary to the computed tomography dye
load that she received on [**7-30**].  At baseline, this
patient has hyponatremia and acidemia secondary to her type I
renal tubular acidosis for which she takes 650 mg twice per
day of bicarbonate.

The patient was gently hydrated on the floor.  Her
electrolytes were repleted, and her medications were renally
dosed.  Her ACE inhibitors and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
agents were held during the course of her hospitalization.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient remained oliguric
with an average urine output of 200 cc to 300 cc per day.

 3.  SEIZURE ISSUES:  The patient had a seizure after being
admitted to the floor on [**8-1**].  She was stabilized, and
the seizure resolved with Ativan and Dilantin.

She was seen in consultation by Neurology.  She had a lumbar
puncture which was negative.  She also had a head computed
tomography at that time which showed edema.  She had magnetic
resonance imaging as well which showed decreased perfusion in
her right frontal lobe as well as a nonspecific increased T2
signal on the pons.  She had an electroencephalogram which
was negative.

Neurology felt that her seizure was caused by a metabolic or
toxic abnormality.  She was loaded with Dilantin and was
continued on Dilantin in the Intensive Care Unit.  She did
not have any additional seizures during the course of her
hospitalization.

 4.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  Congestive heart failure with an
ejection fraction of 20% to 25% and coronary artery disease,
status post stent placement.

After the seizure she suffered on the floor, the patient had
a cardiac enzyme leak and mild electrocardiogram changes;
likely representing demand ischemia.

After her transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, she became
hypotensive which necessitated volume resuscitation.  While
in the Intensive Care Unit, she was diuresed with Lasix and
Diuril.  She was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.  She also
began hemodialysis because she was relatively refractory to
Lasix treatment.

Regarding her congestive heart failure, eventually the
patient was placed on Isordil, hydralazine, and most recently
metoprolol was added to her regimen.  Hemodialysis has been
the most effective treatment in terms of volume reduction.
She continued to receive Lasix 100 mg intravenously three
times per day (per Renal instructions).

 5.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  After the patient's seizure
on the floor, she became overwhelmingly acidotic and was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for her respiratory
failure and was placed on a ventilator.  She was extubated on
[**8-3**] for six hours until she went into flash pulmonary
edema and was reintubated.  At that time, she was started on
Natrecor and then switched to dialysis and received her first
dialysis treatment on [**8-5**]; which she continued to have
on an as needed basis (per Renal directive).

The patient was extubated on [**8-11**] and continued to do
well status post extubation; currently using a 50% shovel
mask with oxygen saturations of 95% to 100% with a
respiratory rate of around 12.  The patient was not
complaining of shortness of breath.

 6.  ANISOCORIA/WEAKNESS ISSUES:  The patient has had noted
anisocoria during her hospitalization with the right pupil
being larger than the left pupil.

However, on the morning of [**8-12**], she was noted to have a
larger left pupil at 4 mm and a right pupil of 2 mm as well
as marked left upper extremity weakness.  At that time,
Neurology was consulted again regarding this new finding.

She was seen today by Neurology and was scheduled for a
magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography
later today (on [**8-12**]).

 7.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
levothyroxine.

 8.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE/ASTHMA ISSUES:
The patient was on Atrovent q.4h. and was started on a
fluticasone steroid inhaler today for continued wheezing and
some chest tightness.

 9.  ANXIETY/DEPRESSION ISSUES:  During the course of her
Intensive Care Unit stay, sertraline was held and she
received Ativan with her propofol sedation.  As she was
extubated, we have restarted Ativan 1 mg by mouth every day
as well as her trazodone 50 mg by mouth once per day.

10.  CODE STATUS:  Full code.

11.  COMMUNICATION ISSUES:  Communication with the family has
been through the patient's sisters.

CONDITION AT TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:  Condition on transfer to
the floor was fair.

NOTE:  This dictation is up to the point of Medical Intensive
Care Unit transfer to CC7 on [**2178-8-12**].

ADDENDUM:  This dictation will cover the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course from [**2178-8-13**] through [**2178-8-21**].  The
early part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was dictated by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM
(CONTINUED):  The patient was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit on [**2178-8-13**].

1.  RENAL ISSUES:  While on the Medicine floor, the patient
underwent further diuresis with Lasix and metolazone.  The
patient was continued on hemodialysis.

The patient was followed closely by the Renal Service.
Gradually, her renal function and acidosis improved.
Therefore, hemodialysis was discontinued.

2.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient underwent a magnetic
resonance imaging of her brain on [**2178-8-13**].  This
magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated areas of signal
abnormalities that probably represented subacute infarction.

A magnetic resonance angiography of the cervical vasculature
revealed no hemodynamically significant stenoses.

The patient was followed closely by the Neurology Service.
It was recommended that she be started on Dilantin for
seizure prophylaxis.  Due to difficulties achieving
therapeutic Dilantin levels, the patient was changed to
Keppra.

Her neurological functional status improved over the
remainder of her hospitalization, and the patient had
improved movement of her left side.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
Isordil, hydralazine, beta blocker, and Lasix.

The Cardiology Service was consulted for further workup of
her cardiomyopathy.  Cardiac catheterization was pursued, yet
this procedure was put on hold given since the patient had
undergone a cardiac catheterization on a previous admission.
The results of that cardiac catheterization were consistent
with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient worked with Physical
Therapy and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Simvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Hydralazine 20 mg by mouth four times per day.
5.  Synthroid 0.088 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Lasix 60 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Keppra 250 mg by mouth twice per day.
8.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Renal tubular acidosis (type 1).
2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Acute renal failure.
5.  Seizures.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
7.  Anxiety.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's discharge status was to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with her primary care physician.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2184-8-20**]):    NO GROWTH
,
CXR ([**2184-8-13**])
Here is atelectasis at the lung bases. There is stable
cardiomegaly. There
is stable prominence of the right hilum, most likely combination
of pulmonary
artery and calcified right hilar lymph nodes. There are no focal
pulmonary
consolidations. There is no free air under the diaphragm.
.
CXR: ([**2184-8-14**])
CT Abdomen and Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. There is stable fat-containing incisional hernia
2. There is a stable small right adrenal adenoma.
3. Extensive atherosclerosis throughout the abdominopelvic
vasculature, which
cannot be further assessed due to lack of intravenous contras
.
CTA Abdomen and Pelvis:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Appearance of the abdominal aorta is unchanged, with chronic
aortic
dissection which is unchanged from the prior study of [**2179**].
Again, a
circumferential ring of calcification is noted which is
predominantly filled
with thrombus. The presumed false lumen on the left fills with
contrast and
feeds the iliac arteries. No evidence of acute aortic dissection
is seen.
2. No evidence of ischemic bowel. Vessels feeding the transplant
kidney
appear patent.
3. Patchy opacities in the right middle lobe may represent
inflammatory or
infectious process. Bibasilar atelectasis. Trace left pleural
effusion
.
pMIBI Stress Test:
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms and no ischemic ST segment
changes.
Nuclear report to be sent separately.
.
CARDIAC PERFUSION PERSANTINE
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is good.
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is a fixed perfusion defect at the base of the inferior
wall, unchanged.
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 51%.
Compared with the study of [**2182-4-24**], the reversible defect of
the apical and
mid inferior wall is not apperent on the current scan.
IMPRESSION: Fixed perfusion defect at the base of the inferior
wall, unchanged.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71yoF ESRD s/p transplant, CAD, COPD, mod pulmonary HTN,
presented with Acute Pulmonary Edema, Hypertensive Urgency and
Severe Abdominal Pain.
.
# Abdominal Pain: The patient presented with abdominal pain with
symptoms initially  out-of-proportion with exam. A CT without
contrast was performed (details above) without evidence acute GI
process. Subsequently the patient underwent a CTA of the abdomen
for which she received IVF and was laid flat during which she
became short of breath and subsequently hypertensive to the
200's (details given below). The pt was seen by Vascular Surgery
in the ED that felt the symptoms were not consistent with acute
mesenteric ischemia and in addition she had a normal lactate.
The final read of the CTA was unreaveling for any acute process.
During the patients hospital course her pain appeared to
localize to the site of the kidney transplant in the LLQ.
Transplant surgery was called to evaluate her transplant kidney,
but subsequent ultrasounds were unrevealing for perinephric
collections, hydronephrosis or signs of ischemia. The patients
abdominal pain resolved by the time of her discharge of which
the differential still remains: Gastritis (possibly secondary to
a recent steroid taper, PUD, Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia
secondary to abundant mesenteric calcifications and chronic
aortic disection.
.
# Acute Pulmonary Edema: Patient with known dCHF with preserved
EF as well as moderate pulmonary HTN. Acute pulmonary edema was
likely excerbated in the setting of hypertensive urgency
following her IVF (given at a rate of 200cc/hr prior to CTA) as
well as HTN secondary to panic as evident by her saying ""I need
air"" in the ED. The patient was brought to the ICU for closer
monitoring and was placed on BiPap as well as given IV Lasix.
Upon transfer to the floor the patients lungs were mostly clear
to ausculation with scant crackls R>L. The pt was clinically
euvolemic and breathing comforatbly on room air. Of note this
presentation very similar to prior admission where pt recieved
fluids and subsequently reqiured tranfer to the unit. The
patient remained on room air for the duration of her
hospitalization.
.
# Hypertensive: Following the patients work-up in the ED the pt
was admitted to the MICU with hypertensive urgency with SBP to
the 200s . The patient was given Labetalol and subsequently
transfered to floor on PO Labetalol for SBP control. The patient
uses Labetalol as a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as an outpatient.  The patient
was started on low-dose calcium blocker (amlodipine) in the
setting of SBPs 140-160s as an inpatient.
.
# ESRD s/p Transplant: The patient was followed by transplant
surgery service while in-house. K+ was 5.9 on admission, and the
pt subsequently received Kayexelate which improved to levels
WNL.  The patients had a baseline creatinine of 1.8 in early
[**Month (only) **]. On admission the patients Cr was elevated at 2.3,
peaking at 2.8 and returning to 2.1 with  gentle hydration. The
patient was continued on home regimen of azathioprine/tacrolimus
while following Tacrolimus levels.
.
# Anemia: The patients HCT ranged from 23 through 28 from
approximately 30s at her baseline in the setting of one recent
episode of dark stools, without frank melena, BRBPR. Patient
chronically on Epogen from long term renal disease. B12 and
folate were WNL and haptoglobin was not decreased.
.
# CAD: Pt with known CAD, followed by cards as outpatient with
known distal RCA occlusion. No symptoms of angina on admission
and  was ruled out with unchanged EKG. The patient then
subsequently developed one episode of chest pain. The patient
was sent for a pMIBI ( as detailed above) that showed no new
lesions.  The pt was continued on ASA and beta-blocker.
.
# Chronic Aortic Disection: Chronic in nature. CT abd with
contrast performed overnight. Pt reporting back pain. Hct has
been slowly decreasing. CT unchanged from prior studies.
.
# COPD: Pt with 40 pack-yr hx. Not on home 02. Recently
completed steroid taper for likely COPD flare.
The pt was continued Nebs PRN.

Brief Hospital Course:
49F with EtOHcirr (MELD 21) hx bowel perforation s/p exlap s/p
closure & repeat exlap hartmann's for free contrast on CT
admitted in the setting of decreased ostomy output. Upon
admission pt was managed with NGT, npo/IVF. Ileography was
perfomred which revealed patent colon with no stricture or
obstruction. On [**2192-2-2**] underwent paracentesis, only able to
aspirate 3 mL. cultures and gram stain were negative. On
ultrasound during paracentesis noted fluid collection around
pancreas that was drained on [**2192-2-3**], removing 950 mLs. Again
gram stain and cultures were negative. Given pt's long duration
of abx therapy since previous admission, afebrile during
addmision, with negative peritoneal fluid cultures, all abx were
stopped on [**2192-2-8**].

On [**2192-2-3**], pt was noted to have increased work of breathing
and decreased oxygen saturdation to 90% on room air. CXR
revealed mild to moderate pulm edema. Pt was transferred to ICU
for observation and diuresis. Transferred to back to floor on
[**2192-2-5**].

Ostomy output increased HD3. Was started on lactulose. Advanced
to clears on [**2192-2-5**] and to regular diet on [**2192-2-9**]. Tolerated
diet fairly well except for two eposides emesis on clear diet.
Noted increased abdominal distention on [**2192-2-8**], KUB at that
time showed no ileus, SBO, or dilated loops of bowel. Air was
seen throughout colon.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3549**] is a 68 year old male with biopsy proven T3N0MX
esophageal adenocarcinoma on EGD/biopsy performed [**2140-8-11**].
Initial PET scan showed GE juntion avidity but no nodal disease.
 He then completed a 6-week course of
neoadjuvent chemotherapy and radiation at [**Hospital3 **] hospital
(chemotherapy completed [**2140-11-2**] and radiation therapy
completed [**2140-11-7**]). His post-chemotherapy course was
complicated by a severe episode of dehydration that warranted
hospitalization at [**Hospital3 417**] hospital on [**2140-11-22**]. During
that
hospitalization there also was concern of G-tube infection which
was subsequently removed. Mr. [**Known lastname 3549**] then spent a period of time
in rehab. Prior to this admission, however, he has been able to
tolerate PO and had weight gain.
Recent follow-up PET scan performed several days preoperatively
did not demonstrate any FDG-avid disease.

(0/31--ypN0).
C.  Submucosal fibrosis and mucosal ulceration consistent with
the patient's history of neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
D.  No precursor dysplasia or intestinal metaplasia identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2141-1-13**], the patient had a minimally invasive esophagectomy.
He tolerated the procedure well. For details, see the
separately-dictated operative note.

NEURO/PAIN:
The patient's pain was initially well-controlled with an
epidural. Upon discontinuatin of the epidural, he was well
controlled on PO tylenol. On POD#1 and POD#2, the patient had
episodes of confusion and agitation, necessitating soft
restraints in the ICU; his mental status improved considerably
after discontinuation of all narcotics, and he remained
generally well-oriented (with only occasional periods of mild
disorientation at night) through to his day of discharge.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable. His
vitals signs were monitored with telemetry.

RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated in the immediate post-op
period successfully. On POD#2, during an episode of agitation,
an ABG showed respiratory alkalosis and mild hypoxia; a CT then
was negative for PE. He subsequently improved from this episode,
both in terms of his mental status and respiratory status. For
the remainder of his stay he maintained good oxygentation with
1-2L supplemental O2 via nasal cannula.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient had a minimally-invasive
esophagectomy on [**2141-1-13**]. He generally followed the MIE pathway.
His j-tube feeds were started on POD#1 and advanced to goal.
During an episode of agitation on POD#2, he did remove his NGT,
and this was replaced without incident. He was NPO until POD#6,
when his barium swallow study showed good passage of contrast
with no leak, and he was advanced to full liquids, which he
tolerated well. He is discharged with VNA and supplies to
continue tube feeding at home.

GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was monitored. A Foley
catheter was placed intra-operatively and removed on POD#5, at
which time the patient was able to successfully void.

HEME: The patient's hematocrit was monitored daily, and he
required no transfusions. His preoperative anticoagulation was
resomed on POD#7 with a lovenox bridge to coumadin.

ID: The patient did have a temperature of 101.2 on POD#2, but
this resolved and he required no antibiotics. He had no further
fevers and his white blood count remained normal. On CXR the day
of discharge he did have a patchy right-sided opacity. However
he remained asymptomatic, afebrile with no productive cough. He
is scheduled for follow up CXR and CBC on follow up next week.

ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was monitored and he had
no significant endocrine issues.

PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was maintained on SQ heparin,
pneumoboots, and encouraged to ambulate with the help of
physical therapy. He was given pantoprazole and an inspiratory
spirometer.

He was discharged in stable condition, pain well controlled,
voiding well, and with instructions and appropriate
prescriptions for supplemental oxygen and tube feeds. He was
instructed to call or return to the ED with concerning symptoms.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting
regional wall
motion abnormalities include mid to apical anteroseptal
akinesis/hypokinesis
and anterior and anterolateral wall hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately
thickened with trace aortic regurgitation. There is mild to
moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve gradient low due to reduced stroke
volume). The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate mitral annular
calcification with a
mild left ventricular inflow gradient. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression:
Moderate regional systolic LV dysfunction c/w CAD
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate aortic stenosis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2105-9-21**], a
slightly higher
aortic valve gradient is now measured (likely related to
slightly better
technical quality of Doppler spectral measurement in the current
study). Left
ventricular systolic function and mitral valve appear similar.
Tricuspid
systolic gradient is now slightly lower.

Cath [**10-23**]:FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel (LAD, LCX) coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG to LAd with normal flow.
3. Successful stenting of the mid LCX with a bare meta (heparin
coated)

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84 y/o F w/ h/o HOCM, CRI, CAD s/p CABG in '[**81**] (SVG
to LAD) and PTCA x 6 who presented to OSH with accelerating
chest pain. Found to have NSTEMI, with a positive troponin of
0.12 and was admitted for cardiac cath.

On cardiac cath [**9-18**] she was found to have an ulcerated 80%
lesion in the proximal SV to LAD graft. She underwent succesful
PTCA/stenting of the proximal and mid SVG to LAD with 2 Zeta
stents. Limited resting hemodynamics showed elevated central
aortic pressures (200/65mmHg). LV gram was not performed due to
renal insufficiency.

The patient recieved IV hydration with bicarb prior to and
post-cath. In the holding area post-cath she became hypoxic
requiring non-rebreather with O2 sats still in the low 90's. She
was felt to be fluid overloaded and a CXR was consistent with
florid CHF. She was given 20 mg IV lasix,then lasix 100mg IV and
was started on Natrecor drip. She was then transferred to the
CCU for further management.

She continued to have SSCP rated from [**Date range (1) 92236**] after arriving
in CCU. SL NTG and Nitro paste were tried with minor relief.
Then the patient was started on Nitro drip + morphine with
relief. Of note, she has tolerated nitrates well despite her h/o
HOCM. Her cardiac enzymes were also elevated overnight post-cath
and this was felt to be possibly related to showering of
microemboli from her SVG into her microvasculature. She
subsequently had resolution of her CK's and chest pain resolved.
However, on return to the floor she had persistent chest pains
despite nitro drip, prompting re-look catheritization.

Re-look cath on [**9-23**] showed the LCX to have serial 70% lesions
at the mid-segment. The SVG-->LAD was patent (mild residual
stenosis at the proximal stent). The mid-LCX was successfully
stented with a bare meta (heparin coated) stent. Of note, the
patient required non-rebreather tx and was transferred to CCU
for management of her CHF. The patinet was diuresed on natrecore
and lasix in the unit and transferred back to the floor on [**9-25**].


On return to the floor she was found to be mildly SOB, without
chest pressure or palpitations. JVP was up at 10cm's and she had
crackles on exam to apices with decreased air movement at the
bases. She was given 200mg IV lasix for goal diuresis of -500cc.
She was continued on lasix prn for goal of even to -500cc/day.
Oxygen status improved and she was able to maintain 96%O2 on RA.


Set-up was made for diialysis on [**9-28**] with permcath placement.
On her second day of dialysis, treatment was terminated early
secondary to chest pain and SOB. NTG x 3 was given with
sub-total relief of symptoms. She had an increased O2
requirement to 4L O2, with increasing SOB overnight. She
desaturated to 88% on 6L NC and was started on a non-rebreather.
At this time, she was found to have elevated JVP, tachypnea and
rales up to the apex. EKG was performed and showed no evidence
of acute MI (in the setting of baseline LBBB). She was given
200mg IV lasix and 250mg IV diuril with minimal response. Nitro
drip was titrated up to 200mcgs and 4mg IV morphine was given to
alleviate chest pain. Foley catheter was placed with minimal
return (<10cc). Natrecor drip was started at 0.01mcg/kg/min. ABG
demonstrated 7.23/65/66 with bicarb of 21, c/w an acute
respiratory acidosis. BIPAP was placed for respiratory support
and she was again transferred to the CCU. Of note, she was found
to have evidence as well of a new LLL pneumonia by CXR ,with a
WBC of 15.6, and was started on Levaquin/Flagyl.

Hemodialysis after transfer to CCU removed 2.0kg, but was c/b
hypotensive episodes w/ SBP decreased to the 70's. Hypotension
resolved with 500 cc NS IVF support. Subsequent hemodialysis was
well tolerated with maintenance of her blood pressures. Of note,
she did have shoulder/chest pain  + throat itchiness on HD #4.
This was alleviated with 4mg morphine and NTG. Chest pain was
noted to be resolved by the end of treatment. She was
transferred back to the floor in stable condition for continued
medical management.

She has been on room air and maintaining sats >93% since return
from CCU on [**10-1**]. Lungs are clear. She has been euvolemic with
current course of Hemodialysis Tu,Th,Sat. She has remained chest
pain free for >3 days. Of note, she is completing a course of
Gentamicin antibiotics for an uncomplicated E.Coli UTI. She will
need 2 more doses upon discharge.

A brief [**Hospital 92237**] hospital problem list is outlined below:

1)CHF: better compensated with diuresis JVD flat; ACE-I,
b-blocker; re-started dig at 0.25 qd. Decreased to 0.0625 qM,W,F
on [**10-9**].

2)CAD: ASA, plavix, statin, BB. tenatative nitrates given HOCM -
has tolerted ntg gtt to date; Remains chest pain free s/p
stenting of SVG to LAD and LCX.

3)ID: [**9-20**] -cultured and treated for Enteroccocus UTI w/
levaquin. Developed MRSE/enterocccus UTI and completed 7 day
course of Vancomycin. She was subsequently started on
Levo/Flagyl for infiltrate on CXR and elevated WBC. However,
given absence of infiltrate on subsequent CXR, Levo/Flagyl was
D/C'd. Repeat urine cultures demonstrated E.coli R to
levaquin/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on Gent at 100mg Bolus, +
60mgQHD x 1 week for uncomplicated E.Coli UTI. This was
increased to 80mg QHD on [**10-9**]. She will need two more doses
after discharge to complete her course.

4)CRF: HD per renal, through tunneled dialysis cath. Early
treatments c/b hypotensive episodes requiring fluid support. She
has tolerated recent treatments well, while maintaining BP's.
She will continue HD Tu,Th,Sat. She will remain on Renegel 1600
TID. She will continue w/ Epo injections at 5,000 Units qHD.
+neprocaps
and QDay electrolyte lab draws.

5)Hypercalcemia: SPEP/UPEP negative. PTH elevated, likely
secondary to ESRD, but will need outpatient follow-up to check
Vitamin D levels and potentially a Parathyroid U/S to evaluate
for adenoma.

6)severe arthritis: darvocet
7)FEN: low Na, cardiac, renal diet, fluid restrict 1500cc.
8)Access: L PICC in place, L dialysis cath
9)RLQ abdominal pain: No guarding or rebound. CT abdomen/pelvis

with 5 views for planned hip repair once medically stable. She
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-26**] weeks. Continue percocet prn
for pain control. Encourage ambulation/PT to improve functional
status.
11)prophylaxis-PPI,Heparin SQ
12) anemia: likely [**1-26**] chronic dx, + GI bleed. Transfused to
maintain hct>30.
13) Respiratory: Has been on room air since return from CCU on
[**10-1**]. Lungs are clear. If becomes SOB and appears volume
overloaded, she may need emergent HD. This has not been an issue
to date. Of note, she has previously has had poor response to
medical diuresis: 200mg IV lasix and 250mg IV diuril were used
prior to CCU stay w/ poor effect.
14) sleep: please try trazadone or hydroxizine (vestoril) for
sleep. She has significant difficulties falling asleep at night.

PROCEDURE:  Ileostomy take down.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old
Caucasian lady who is status post kidney-pancreas transplant
with subsequent failure of kidney transplant due to torsion
and a kidney retransplantation approximately one year prior
to this admission.  She also had a recent event of subtotal
colectomy for diffused colitis of unspecific etiology.  She
had a recent admission for partial small bowel obstruction,
which resolved with conservative therapy.  She is now
readmitted with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal distention.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, end-stage renal disease,
coronary artery disease, legally blind, hypertension,
gastroparesis, asthma, partial strokes, small bowel
obstruction, toxic megacolon, status post kidney and pancreas
transplant in [**2-22**], kidney retransplant in [**2-23**], ventral
hernia repair, PD catheter placement, coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2126**], and subtotal colectomy with ileostomy in
[**10-26**].

MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix
2. Prednisone.
3. Reglan
4. Imuran.
5. Ambien.
6. Norvasc.
7. Tacrolimus.
8. Lopressor.
9. Sodium bicarbonate.
10.      Bactrim.
11.      Loperamide.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, she is alert and oriented.
Blood pressure was 130/70, heart rate was 98, and she was
afebrile.  Head and neck exam was unremarkable.  Chest was
clear to auscultation.  Heart sounds were normal.  Her
abdomen was soft and moderately distended with no tenderness.
Of note, on digital exam of the ileostomy there was a
tightness of the fascia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted with partial bowel
obstruction and a nasogastric tube was placed and IV
hydration started.  An abdominal x-ray showed some distended
small bowel loops.  Her abdomen remained soft and nontender.
During this admission, we decided, as she was over two months
out from her colectomy, to take down the ileostomy and
restore bowel continuity.  She was, therefore, taken to the
operating room after appropriate hydration and an ileostomy
take down and ileorectal anastomosis performed without
difficulty.  She developed some oliguria postoperatively and
required a short stay in the intensive care unit.  Subsequent
to that, she made a good recovery and had early return of
bowel function and tolerated a diet.  She was discharged home
by one week postoperatively in a stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Partial small bowel obstruction.

Type I diabetes, status post kidney-pancreas transplantation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She is to resume her routine
immunosuppressant medications per the transplant center.

FOLLOW UP:  In the Transplant Center.

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-5-19**] left internal jugular vein dialysis catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90678**] is an 82y/o gentleman with critical AS ([**Location (un) 109**]
<0.8cm2), Afib on Coumadin, CHF (EF 30-35%), HTN, HLD, DM II,
CKD IV (Cr ~4 baseline), and CML who presented to the ED with
shortness of breath and hemoptsysis and has been found to have
CHF exacerbation.

Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiology [**Date range (1) 90681**]
for CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary indiscretion.
During that stay, he was diuresed with IV Lasix and transitioned
to 160mg PO BID. His stay was complicated by hematuria (had CBI
per Urology and was d/c'd to rehab with no foley), so his
Warfarin had been held on discharge. Also had [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD
(baseline Cr is 2.5, bumped to 4.8 likely from CIN, was down to
2.8 upon discharge). There have been ongoing outpatient
discussions about TAVI vs AVR (he has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
consultation).

He has been doing okay at rehab but developed worsening DOE. Has
SOB at rest and any exertion, fatigue. He reports a 7 pound
weight gain in one week. Also had hemoptysis last night,
approximately 1 tablespoon, only once. He again notes dietary
indescretions (including pork loins, etc). In the ED, initial
vitals were 98.0 77 122/64 24 99% 2L Nasal Cannula. Labs notable
for WBC 17.2 (86.7%N, no bands), Hct 29 (which is baseline), Cr
2.7 (baseline 2.5), INR 2.6. Troponin 0.14, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 90682**]. Lactate
1.2. EKG showed atrial fibrillation per report, although this
EKG is not in the chart. CXR with bibasilar opacities and
pulmonary edema that is significantly worse when compared to
[**4-23**]. He received cefepime 2gm, vancomycin 1gm, furosemide 100mg
IV ONCE, ASA 325mg PO ONCE. A foley catheter was placed, which
drained 800cc and DNR/DNI status was confirmed.

No major overnight events.  His systolic BP has been ~100 so
lasix gtt has been on and off.  He is breathing OK this AM.  Is
hungry and tired from his long ED visit last night.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
(+) Red urine (but only since the foley was placed last night)
(-) No chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness.  No
constipation/diarrhea.  No rash.  No weakness,
numbness/tingling.

CXR PA&LAT [**2187-5-14**]:
Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.  Incompletely
characterized right basilar opacification, which may reflect a
pleural
effusion, but is not well characterized.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2187-5-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Air outlines the anterior wall of the bladder which could
represent
cystitis in the appropriate clinical setting.  Additionally,
there is a focal area of heterogeneous dense material within the
bladder lumen which suggests a focal mass.  Urine cytology and
further assessment with either ultrasound or direct urological
evaluation should be considered.
2.  Minimal atherosclerotic calcification of the common and
external iliac and common femoral vessels.
3.  Increased trabeculation of the right ilium, consistent with
Paget's
disease.
.
CXR [**2187-5-19**]:
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from [**2187-5-14**].
There is a left IJ central venous catheter with distal lead tip
in the brachiocephalic vein.  This could be advanced several
centimeters for more optimal placement.  There are persistent
bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  There is
unchanged cardiomegaly.  There is mild pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2187-5-23**]:
FINDINGS:  A single portable chest radiograph is limitted by low
lung volumes and mild rotation.  Mild pulmonary edema has
improved but there is now a small amout of fluid in the right
minor fissure.  A left internal jugular catheter tip remains at
the confluence of the left brachiocephalic and SVC.  Apparent
worsening of cardiomegally is likely secondary to technique.
FINDINGS:  Slight improvement in pulmonary edema.
.
KUB [**2187-5-23**]:
FINDINGS:  Portable supine and upright frontal views of the
abdomen
demonstrate a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with gas in
non-distended loops of small and large bowel.  No air-fluid
levels are seen.  The right hemidiaphragm is excluded from view
on these images which limits evaluation for free intraperitoneal
air.  However, there is no evidence of a large amount of free
air within the abdomen.  Multilevel moderate degenerative
changes are noted in the visualized lower thoracic and lumbar
spine.  The visualized right lung base is clear, but there is
apparent rightward shifting of mediastinum.  The left lung base
is not well evaluated.  Recommend correlation with same day
chest radiograph.
IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without gaseous
distention of the colon.

[**2187-6-5**] RUQ ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS:  Note is made that only a partial ultrasound exam was
performed as the patient refused to complete the examination.
No biliary dilatation is seen.  No focal liver lesion is
identified.  The
gallbladder is contracted.  The portal vein is patent with
hepatopetal flow.  The intrahepatic portion of the IVC is
unremarkable.  There is a right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Contracted gallbladder with no biliary dilatation.  No focal
liver lesion is seen.
2.  Right pleural effusion. Only a partial exam was performed as
the patient refused to complete.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90678**] is an 82 year old gentleman with critical aortic
stenosis (AS), Afib on Coumadin, chronic kidney disease (CKD)
stage IV (Cr ~2.5 baseline), and chronic myelocytic leukemia
(CML) who presented with acute on chronic systolic heart
failure.  He was thought not to be a candidate for any aortic
valve procedures including balloon valvuloplasty and his kidneys
did not tolerate diuretics for the heart failure exacerbation.
He was transferred to the CCU for CVVH which brought him back to
euvolemia and he was transitioned to intermittent HD.  His
course was complicated by C.difficile diarrhea, development of
peripheral blasts in the setting of his CML, and probable
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.  He eventually expired on
[**2187-6-6**] from a PEA arrest after having chest pain during
hemodialysis earlier in the day, he was DNR/DNI so resuscitation
was not attempted.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure (sCHF): He presented
with progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower
extremity edema consistent with acute on chronic sCHF.  Most
recent TTE from previous admission in [**3-/2187**] showed EF 30-35%,
likely due to critical AS (see below). (Cardiac cath during
previous admission showed no clinically significant coronary
artery disease.)  He was started on IV lasix gtt, however
diuresis was difficult due to his low blood pressure and his
preload dependence from AS.  Also, his creatinine continued to
rise.  His urine output declined and on HD#6 he was transferred
to CCU for initiation of CVVH for volume removal (see below).
He did well and returned to [**Location 52753**] on CVVH with removal of
10L of fluid.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt has stage IV CKD with most
recent creatinine on discharge 2.5.  His creatinine gradually
increased from 2.7 on admission to 4.7 and BUN 110-120.  This
was felt most likely due to decreased renal perfusion in setting
of acute on chronic heart failure.  His urine output declined
and he began to demonstrate signs and symptoms of uremia with
nausea/vomiting, AMS and asterixis.  The renal service was
consulted and recommended trial of more aggressive diuresis with
metolazone/lasix.  His urine output did not improve and he was
transferred to the CCU for placement of temporary dialysis line
and CVVH.  He did well and returned to [**Location 52753**] on CVVH with
removal of 10L of fluid.  After discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
family about no options for valve repair, he was trialed on
intermittent HD.  He did tolerate intermittent HD with blood
pressures in the 70s/40s but he was mentating.  He was started
on 10mg midodrine prior to dialysis and a tunnelled HD line was
placed to allow for outpatient HD.  Was continued on calcium
TID, calcitriol daily, and sevalamer with meals.  Kayexelate was
used for hyperkalemia between HD sessions.  There had been
discussions with renal and transplant surgery about
transitioning to peritoneal dialysis which might be gentler on
the patient's blood pressure.  However, the patient developed
HITT and then expired before this was carried out.

# Critical AS: Pt has known critical AS (most recent [**Location (un) 109**]
<0.8cm2).  He has been evaluated for his options to repair or
replace aortic valve, including AVR, TAVI, or balloon
angioplasty. He was deemed to be a high risk candidate for
surgical AVR, and unfortunately he does not qualify for the
CoreValve protocol because of his renal insufficiency (creatine
clearance < 20 cc).  The risks and benefits of valvuloplasty
were discussed with the patient and his family, including
likelihood that he would continue to be HD-dependent as well as
risk of stroke.  It was decided that he would not undergo
balloon valvuloplasty and to transition to HD as above for fluid
management.  Later in the hospitalization, the family again
pushed for balloon valvuloplasty and there were discussions with
the interventional cardiologist about possible valvuloplasty
however the patient developed HITT and these discussions were
held.

# Heparin-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (HITT): After
several days of heparin used for anticoagulation of afib as well
as for dialysis, he developed thrombocytopenia.  Platelets were
noted to decrease from 232 on [**5-25**] to nadir of 66 on [**5-31**]. This
was in the setting of restarting hydroxyurea. He had no clinical
evidence of thrombotic disease.  His HITT antibody was positive
at an optical density which suggested to hematology consultant
that he did indeed have HITT.  There was a serotonin release
assay sent to confirm this diagnosis which was pending when he
expired.  He was taken off heparin and started on argatroban to
stop thrombosis from HITT as well as prophylaxis for his afib
with CHADS2 score of 6.  All further discussions for balloon
valvuloplasty and peritoneal dialysis catheter placement were on
hold pending HITT work-up.

# C.diff associated diarrhea: He developed large volume diarrhea
and a C.diff was positive.  He was initially treated with PO
vancomycin only because of his age, creatinine, and WBC count.
However, his leukocytosis continued to worsen so IV flagyl was
added to the regimen and his PO vancomycin dose was increased to
500 mg Q6h.  When he continued to have rising leukocytosis on
this regimen a repeat set of cultures was sent on all body
fluids and his urine grew VRE (see below).  The antibiotic
steward recommended use fo tigecycline to dual treat VRE in the
urine and C.diff.  His diarrhea resolved, as well as abdominal
pain and it was felt that his rising leukocytosis was due to
leukemoid reaction of abnormal bone marrow from CML (see below).
 He was narrowed again to PO vancomycin 125 po q6 hours to
complete a 14 day course following completion of 7 days of
tigecycline 50 mg q12h for VRE in the urine.  His course was
supposed to finish on [**6-13**].

# Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE): His urine culture did
grow VRE on two occasions.  He was felt to be colonized with
this pathogen because his urinalysis both times had 16 and then
3 WBCs, which would be expected to have a more robust pyuria if
he was acutely infected.  Nonetheless, because of rising
leukocytosis, he was treated for VRE with tigecycline which
would dual-cover his C.diff above.  He completed a 7 day course
for complicated urinary tract infection since male gender and
foley.  Even after treatment, his renal failure did not improve.

# Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML): Pt's WBC gradually
increased from 17.2 on admission to peak of 84.  Infectious work
up revealed C.diff infection and colonization of urine with
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (cultures positive but UA
without pyuria indicating asymptomatic colonization).
Nonetheless, his white count continued to rise even after
clinical resolution of C.diff and with empiric treatment of VRE.
 Felt most likely due to CML since his hydroxyurea was recently
discontinued due to renal failure and thrombocytopenia.  The
Atrius oncology service was consulted and recommended restarting
hydroxyurea.  He did also eventually develop a small percentage
of his differential with peripheral blasts but this may have
been a leukemoid reaction.  Given his overall poor prognosis it
was decided to continue just the hydroxyurea without pursuing
more aggressive work up such as bone marrow biopsy.  His WBC
gradually downtrended on hydroxyurea 1000 mg daily before
reducing to 500mg daily in setting of thrombocytopenia.

# Hematuria: Pt had hematuria during previous admission that
required CBI and holding anticoagulation.  Warfarin was
restarted at [**Hospital **] rehab facility and pt had gross hematuria on
admission.  He had CT abdomen/pelvis in the ED which showed
question of focal density in the bladder lumen, which is most
likely clot but raises concern for malignant lesion.  The
urology service was consulted and recommended sending urine
cytology and outpatient f/u with cystoscopy in [**12-25**] weeks after
discharge.  Urine cytology was negative for malignant cells.

# Hemoptysis: Pt reported one episode of hemoptysis on the night
prior to admission (approx 1 tbsp).  He did not have hemoptysis
during admission, and it was felt that this most likely occured
due to CHF exacerbation and anticoagulation.

# Afib: CHADS2 score 6. Rate was well controlled on home
metprolol.  INR was therapeutic on admission but warfarin was
held for much of the admission while awaiting decisions on the
aortic valve proceudres and for placement of dialysis catheters.
 He was maintained on heparin IV during this time with PTT
60-100. However, given concern for HITT later in hospital stay,
patient was transitioned to argatroban infusion with the same
target PTT.

# Hypertension (HTN): Systolic blood pressures during admission
were ranging from 70s-90s even on intermittent HD.  This was
felt due to critical AS and heart failure as above.  His

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue, weight gain, lower extremity edema and increasing
abdominal girth

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
 65 male with a history of NASH cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CAD s/p
CABG, DM2 on insulin, PAD s/p bilateral iliac stenting presents
with a 6 week history of increasing abdominal distention,
fatigue and worsening lower extremity edema.  The patient was
first diagnosed with cirrhosis [**8-/2136**] and underwent a TIPS
procedure [**2137-6-13**]. His cirrhosis has been complicated by
ascites requiring repeated LVP (past 7 months), encephelopathy,
SBP and HRS.  He was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 28235**] to the liver service for similiar complaints. During
that admission, he was treated for hepatic encephalopathy with
lactulose/rifaximin, and SBP with 5 day course of ceftriaxone.
Discharged on prophylactic ciprofloxacin 500mg daily. Course c/b
[**Last Name (un) **] with Cr rising to 1.4, and he was diagnosed with HRS type 2
after he did not respond to albumin administration. Plan was to
follow-up with Nephrology as outpatient. He has a history of
diuretic refractory ascites, and required 2 paracenteses during
the admission. Ultrasound showed TIPS patent. Was discharged off
diuretics given worsening renal function and concern for
electrolyte abnormalities. During the admission, his chronic
hyponatremia worsened with administration of Bumex and
spironolactone, and improved when these meds were held. Since
discharge, the patient has noted increasing abdominal girth,
weight gain, and worsening fatigue. 1 day PTA, he presented to
[**Hospital3 **] for repeat paracentesis.  There, he was noted to
be more edematous on exam.  Patient mentions that the edema has
been getting progressively worse for the past several weeks.
His labs at [**Hospital1 **] were notable for hyponatremia with Na 116, WBC
6.5, K 5.3, Cr 1.6, AST 36, ALT 35, Tbili 1.0, AP 212, TSH 3.98,
Albumin 3.1, lactate 1.4. Per report, ultrasound there did not
show any evidence of fluid ammenable to paracentesis. Was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial VS were 99 81 107/36 14 96%. Labs notable for
Na 114 (recent baseline 120-127), K 5.6, Cr 1.7 (recently
1.4-1.5), ALT 39, AST 44, AP 197, Tbili 1.1, Alb 3.2, Hct 25.8
(baseline 24-25), WBC 6.1 with 81.5% neutr. No imaging done
here. Patient received zofran for nausea. Liver consulted, who
recommended fluid restriction. Recommended albumin if worsening
renal failure, but as Cr 1.7 (which is near recent baseline), no
albumin given. Was admitted for further work-up and treatment of
hyponatremia and cirrhosis. VS prior to transfer 97.8 76 103/36
15 95%.

On the floor, the patient reports significant fatigue. He denies
chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea or lightheadness.

Past Medical History:
- Recent diagnosis of cirrhosis in [**4-/2136**] in the setting of
increasing abdominal girth. Transjugular liver biopsy on
[**2136-9-13**] confirmed cirrhosis. Upper endoscopy [**2136-10-30**] negative
for esophageal varices. Cirrhosis complicated by recurrent
ascites requiring LVP every 2 weeks. Now s/p TIPS [**6-13**]. Also c/b
SBP, encephalopathy, HRS.
- CAD s/p CABG
- DM2
- PAD s/p iliac stenting

stent to which
attention can be paid on follow-up.
2.  Cirrhosis, no focal liver lesion.
3.  Moderate volume ascites.
4.  Left portal vein not well visualized.  This could be
technical but is not further evaluated on this study.
.
[**2137-7-25**] MIBI stress test
IMPRESSION:
1) Ascites
2) No evidence of focal myocardial perfusion defects.
.
[**2137-7-25**] Stress EKG (pharmacologic)
IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes. No anginal type symptoms.
Appropriate hemodynamic response to Regadenoson. Nuclear report
sent
separately.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M w/ NASH cirrhosis h/o SBP and TIPS with recent revision,
refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, who presented with
lethargy and hyponatremia. Course complicated by HRS and
malnutrition. Approved for transplant waiting list during this
admission.

# Hyponatremia: Presented with lethargy, sodium of 114,
concerning for an acute on chronic process, as his records
indicate a baseline sodium level of 125-130. Due to [**Last Name (un) **] on prior
admission at [**Hospital1 18**] discharged [**7-10**], patient has not been on
diuretics.  Patient was started on hypertonic saline drip in the
ICU and improvement of Na to >120 was noted by hospital day 2
and hypertonic saline was discontinued prior to transfer to the
liver service. Renal was consulted, and he had a TSH and
cortisol check, both of which were normal. Patient was managed
with fluid restriction and salt restriction. Sodium on discharge
was 133.
- Continue to fluid restrict to 750cc/day, 2g Na restriction
- Continue to hold diuretics for [**Last Name (un) **]

#Renal Failure: Acute on Chronic renal failure from baseline Cr
of 1.4. Likely HRS type 2 chronically, now exacerbated by HRS
Type I. Renal was consulted. Creatinine finally improved with
aggressive albumin resucitation and maximum doses of midodrine
and octreotide. 24 hr urine collection showed CrCl 23 while
creatinine was still elevated. If renal function worsens again
and cannot recover, may need repeat creatinine clearance, as if
GFR <25 for 2 weeks he may be a candidate for combined
liver-kidney transplant. At time of discharge patient was back
to about baseline on midodrine alone.
- Continue to hold diuretics
- Continue midodrine 15mg TID PO
- Follow up in transplant clinic as scheduled

# Cirrhosis: NASH cirrhosis s/p TIPS, cirrhosis complicated by
HE, SBP, HRS,  MELD on transfer from MICU was 20, decreased to
15 at time of discharge. Patient approved for transplant waiting
list during this admission.
- SBP: h/o SBP, neg diagnostic paracentesis x2 this admission,
on cipro ppx
- Hepatic Encephalopathy: on lactulose, rifaximin. AMS resovled,
no asterixis at discharge
- Varices: None on OSH EGD, not on nadolol
- Ascites: Off diuretics for HRS, fluid and Na restriction; TIPS
patent on US [**2137-7-21**]
- Patient will follow up in transplant clinic

#Malabsorption: Severe nutritional deficiency as evidenced via
physical appearance of cachexia, bitemporal wasting, and albumin
of 3.1. Pt currently on tube feeds [**12-20**] malabsorption in setting
of NASH cirrhosis, gastric bypass surgery. He will need to be on
tube feeds indefinitely. As pt has distorted anatomy due to
roux-en-y gastric bypass, and will likely have recurrent large
volume ascites, a PEG tube is not a viable option for tube
feeds, so must use dobhoff. Nutrition was consulted, patientn
was on nepro tube feeds for hyperkalemia early in the admission,
transitioned back to isosource prior to discharge as was
normo-hypokalemic.
- Continue tube feeds at home via dobhoff

#DM: Sugars were difficult to control during this admission
while on tubefeeds and octreotide was also likely contributing
factor. Was discharged on slightly increased basal insulin dose,
and octreotide was not continued at discharge.
- Instructed to follow up closely with PCP for diabetes
management

# Falls: Patient had right arm pain and edema, ecchymosis s/p
fall in transit to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH. No indwelling CVC to increase
risk of upper extremity DVT, plainfilm of R should without
fracture or dislocation. Improved without intervention. Of note,
patient also had a mechanical fall during this admission without
loss of conciousness. He did not recall hitting his head but the
following day he was noted to have left eye scleral hemorrhage
in addition to several new ecchymoses and lacerations.
Ophtomology consult was deferred as patient had normal EOM and
no vision changes.

# Troponemia: Obtained for unclear reasons during MICU work up,
Trop-T 0.18 to 0.25 in setting of worsening renal function
however in patient with known CAD s/p CABG. EKG with no ischemic
changes from prior.  Patient without chest pain and without
events on telemetry. Nuclear stress testing for transplant work
up did not show any evidence of ischemic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year-old man with HTN, DM2, hyperlipidemia, CAD, recent PE on
coumadin, who was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on
[**2148-5-3**] for sepsis secondary to pneumonia (thought to be
community-acquired vs aspiration).  His antihypertensives were
initially held, though they were restarted in the setting of his
NSTEMI.  He was put on empiric ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
metronidazole to cover both community-acquired and aspiration
bacterial pathogens and has symptomatically improved.  A speech
and swallow evaluation was concerning for esophageal dysphagia;
since this was known to be old by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], further
evaluation was deferred for now; he was kept on a diet of ground
solids and thin liquids.  Prior to discharge, his antibiotic
regimen was simplified to levofloxacin and metronidazole to
complete a 10-day course.
.
On admission, he was also found to have an NSTEMI with CKs
peaking at [**2160**] in the setting of marked anterior ST depressions
which subsequently improved; he was not heparinized due to his
supratherapeutic INR, and he was loaded with clopidogrel.  A TTE
showed a marked drop in his LVEF to 25% (from 71% on nuclear
stress in [**10/2146**]) presumed secondary to ischemia.  In the
setting of this NSTEMI and also due to clinical volume overload,
he was diuresed with a series of Lasix boluses.  The MICU team
chose to start him on Plavix to help maximize his medical
management.  A cardiology consultation was obtained; they
recommended adding an ACEi to help maximize his medical
management.  They also reviewed his cardiac cath report from
[**1-/2148**] and recommended that he have a P-MIBI due to this new,
large drop in his LVEF.  Per cardiology, even if he had a large
reversible defect on his MIBI, his [**1-/2148**] cath report showed few
(if any) options for potential further revascularization.  In
light of this, both the patient and his PCP chose to defer the
MIBI at this time and maximize his medical management.
.
He was on home warfarin given his recent diagnosis of pulmonary
embolism.  On admission, however, he was noted to have a
markedly elevated INR which was presumed to be due to his
concurrent antibiotic use.  His INR subsequently rose >9 and he
was given 2 units of FFP while in the MICU.  His warfarin was
initially held but, as his INR came down, he was restarted on a
reduced dose (1mg) of warfarin.  On the day prior to discharge,
his INR dropped to 1.8, which is below therapeutic level; he was
bridged with treatment-dose enoxaparin on that day and his INR
was 2.0 by the next day.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be in acute-on-chronic renal failure
upon admission.  Following aggressive hydration in the ED,
however, his creatinine quickly returned to baseline.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a severe pneumonia as
well as a heart attack.  Your pneumonia has improved with
antibiotics, and we will send you home to complete a course of
these antibiotics.  For your heart attack, you and your PCP have
decided to maximize your medical management rather than pursue a
stress test and possible invasiuve catheterization since it is
unlikely that a catheterization would be of much benefit.
.
You were seen by the cardiology service while you were here who
recommended starting you on two new medications (lisinopril and
Plavix) which we will give you prescriptions for.  We also
decreased the dose of your Coumadin to only 1mg.

up and experienced emesis x 3; he went back to sleep, but then
noticed that the emesis was dark/bloody when he woke up the next
day and saw it on the floor outside his [**Doctor Last Name **]. He prepared to come
in to [**Location (un) 86**] for further evaluation at sunrise, but then
experienced further n/v and bloody/dark emesis immediately prior
to arrival here. In the ED, his initial VS were 98.7, 120's,
135/74, 18, and 98%; he has continued to vomit bloody/dark
emesis while here, and so two large bore IV's were placed. He
has since received 2L NS, protonix IV, octreotide bolus + gtt,
and zofran x 2 for nausea. The GI team has been made aware of
the patient; given his varices, GI has recommended no NGT
placement and rapid transfer to MICU for EGD.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. GI bleed: Patient was admitted to ICU for supportive care for
active GI bleeding.  He received IV fluids and blood transfusion
to maintain hematocrit.  He was also started on an octreotide
drip.  GI consulted and performed an EGD which showed 2 grade II
esophageal varices which were banded.  The gastric mucosa was
consistent with portal gastropathy but there was no active
bleeding.  The patient also received Vitamin K for an elevated
INR.  After the EGD, the patient's Hematocrit remained stable
for the duration of the hospitalization and there were no
further signs of bleeding.  The patient was on IV Protonix [**Hospital1 **]
during the acute phase of the bleed.

2. HCV Cirrhosis: During the hospitalization there was no
evidence of fulminant hepatic failure or evidence of hepatic
encephalopathy.  Nadolol was held until bleeding resolved and
then restarted.  Pt was also on ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis
while in the hospital.  Lactulose was not continued since the
patient did not display any signs of encephalopathy.

3. ETOH abuse: Patient had mild withdrawl symptoms on admission.
 He was started on a valium CIWA scale.  This was continued
until discharge but the patient did not show any serious signs
of withdrawal.  On discharge he was given a short course of
librium.  Social work was also consulted about addiction
counseling and the patient received information on detox/rehab
programs.

4. Hematology:  Thrombocytopenia likely due to liver failure and
direct alcohol toxicity.  Platelets remained stable through
latter part of hospital course.  No tranfusions were required.
As stated above, pt received Vit K for high INR.  However, INR
remained mildly elevated due to synthetic liver dysfunciton.

5.  Chronic lower back pain:  Treated with codeine.  Pt will f/u

History of Present Illness:
53 y/o spanish speaking female admitted from the ED with
hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was reportedly found down
at home by her daughter, nonresponsive, and was brought in via
EMS.
.
In the ED she was found to be somnolent with pinpoint pupils and
a paCO2 of 91. Note was made of ""frequent narcotics overdoses""
but this is not mentioned on her discharge summaries, narcotics
are not part of any known prescribed medications, and she has
not had a history of posative tox screens. She was given narcan
with no response. She was placed on BiPap with worsening of her
PaCO2 to 99. She was intubated and placed on assist control.
Approximately 1h later, she was noted to be hypoxc and
hypotensive. It was thought to be breath staking and auto-peep
and she was paralyzed with vecuronium and dissconected from the

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old woman with COPD, p/w somnolence
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for infiltrate
SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

HISTORY: 52-year-old woman with COPD, presents with somnolence;
evaluate for infiltrate.

FINDINGS: Limited single bedside AP examination labeled ""upright
at 23:30"" is compared with series of recent examinations.
Allowing for the markedly lordotic positioning, there is
cardiomegaly, unchanged. Allowing for the limitations above,
there is no definite evidence of CHF. There is prominence of the
central vessels, which may represent underlying pulmonary
hypertension. There is right basilar scarring or atelectasis,
but no focal consolidation or large effusion

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2119-11-27**] 2:12 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: assess for ICH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old woman with obtundation, intubated for hypercarbic
respiratory distress
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for ICH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 53-year-old woman with obtundation. Evaluate for
intracranial hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: [**2118-10-30**].

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift
of normally midline structures, or infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The ventricles are normal in size
and configuration. The osseous structures demonstrate mild
opacification of the maxillary sinuses and ethmoid air cells.
The mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2119-11-29**] 8:45 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old woman with hypercarbic respiratory failure,
intubated, s/p ETT placement.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change
HISTORY: Respiratory failure with intubation.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-28**], there is poor
definition of the left hemidiaphragm with increased
opacification in the retrocardiac region. This is consistent
with atelectasis or even pneumonia at the left base. The
remainder of the examination is unchanged, with substantial
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without vascular
congestion. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes remain in
position.

IMPRESSION: Interval increased opacification behind the heart
consistent with left basilar atelectasis or even pneumonia


Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: In the ED she was found to be
somnolent with pinpoint pupils and a paCO2 of 91. She was given
narcan with no response. She was placed on BIPAP with worsening
of her PaCO2 to 99. A CT Head was negative. She was intubated
and subsequently admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. In
the ICU, pt was maintained on AC ventilation.  It was felt that
the patients respiratory failure was likely secondary to BiPap
non-compliance, as has had history of hypercapnic failure;
Patient tolerated weaning off ventilator well, and was
successfully extubated with assistance of interventional
pulmonology on hospital day on [**11-29**] 07.  The patient was
initially started on antibiotics for a concern of pneumonia
(Vanco/Azithro/Ceftriaxone) but this was discontinued on
hospital day #4 as there was no growth on cultures.  Patient was
continued on her CPAP both during the evening while sleeping and
during the day while napping. Pt was transferred to the floor on
[**2119-11-30**].  She was continued on CPAP and did well throughout the
rest of her stay.  A CPAP machine was ordered as well as home O2
for the patient upon discharge.
.
# Altered MS: Pt was initially unresponsive secondary to
respiratory failure, however this quickly improved.  She was at
her baseline throughout the rest of her stay.  Social work, OT,
and PT were all consulted concerning her dispo given that it was
unclear if patient could care for herself at home.  PT did not
feel she required additional services. OT felt pt needed 24 hour
monitoring.  Case management discussed this with the daughter
who felt that she was able to take care of her at home 24 hours
per day.  The patient and her daughter both did not want a rehab
facility or [**Hospital3 **] for the patient.
.
# Leukocytosis: Pt was initially febrile, had leukocytosis and a
question of infiltrate on her CXR. Cultures showed gram stain
positive for GP cocci and GN rods. She received a 4 day course
of Vanc, Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone, discontinued after
cultures showed no growth. Urine cultures and blood cultures
also showed no growth. Ultimately, her elevated WBC was felt to
be secondary to increased steroid dosing which was started for
possible airway edema. Patients WBC trended down.  It rose on
the day of discharge however she was afebrile, asymptomatic and
a CXR and U/A were both negative.
.
# Edema: Patient has developed lower extremity edema, and
reports often needing Lasix in the hospital for fluid balance.
She was given a few doses of Lasix, however when her Na rose
(see below) the lasix was discontinued.
.
# Panhypopituitarism: THe patient was resumed on her home
medications onc eshe was extubated which included desmopressin
0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 20 mg daily, and levothyroxine 125 mcg.
.
# Hypernatremia: Pt was hypernatremic during her admission.
This was thought to be due to poor PO intake.  Free water was
encouraged.  She also received 2 boluses of D5.  Her sodium
subsequently improved and remained stable.
.
# Hypertension: Pt was continued on her home medication of
Valsartan 80 daily.  Her blood pressure remained elevated and
Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was added.  This improved her BP control.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were found down
and unresponsive by your daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] were found to be in
acute respiratory failure.  You were initially intubated to keep
your airway stable.  You were admitted the the intensive care
unit for closer monitoring.  It was thought that the episode was
likely due to not using your CPAP machine at home and possibley
from not taking all your medications as directed.  In addition,
you had a CT of your head which did not show any abnormalities.
You also were started on antibiotics for the concern of an
infection but were taken off them after 4 days because there was
no evidence of one.

You will need to always use your CPAP machine at home while you
are sleeping, whether it is a nap during the day or sleeping
during the night.  You also need to make sure you take all of
your prescribed medications.

You were started on a medicine for your blood pressure called
Metoprolol. You need to take this twice daily.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with a history of COPD on
home O2 2-4LNC, bronchiechtasis with multiple recurrent
pneumonias, dCHF, a fib not on coumadin, AS s/p balloon
valvuloplasty who presents with acute shortness of breath and
[**Known lastname **] with green/yellow sputum. Of note, she was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (2) 111100**] for acute dCHF, acute COPD
and treated with diuresis and steroids with improvement in her
symptoms. She grew pan-resistant pseudamonas but was thought to
be a colonizer per ID c/s. She was discharged on a long steroid
taper, starting at prednisone 5 daily x 1 week, followed by
prednisone 2.5 daily x 1 week, then to stop. She was still
taking 5 a day when her symtptoms began 3 days prior to
presentation. She first noted increasing [**Date range (2) **] with heavy
green/yellow sputum that was new. She also noted associated
dyspnea worsening with the [**Date range (2) **]. Within 1-2 days prior to
presentation she noticed increasing wheezing, orthopnea, mild
weight gain (4lbs from 266->270lbs in 24 hours), pedal edema.
She also complained of generalized malaise and weakness. Due to
this constellation of symptoms, she decided to come to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were 99  131/99  100  18  94%3L.
She was thought to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure
requiring bipap with her initial ABG 7.33/79/181. Repeat 1 hr
after bipap trial was 7.42.60/174 while on 2LNC. She was given 2
doses of albuterol nebulizer without clear improvement in her
symptoms, but it did lead to thick yellow sputum clearance. Her
pressures remained in the 90s/40s while on bipap. After bipap
her pressures improved and she was given lasix 40mg IV ONCE for
presumed pulmonary edema. She made approximately 300cc of urine
after this bolus. She had a foley and 1 20 gauge IV placed. Her
last set of vitals were 98.6  95  100/50  26  96%2LNC.
.
In the MICU, she continued to have a heavy [**Date range (2) **] with heavy
secretions and remained mildly dyspneic and mildly tachypneic.
She also became hypotensive to the high 70s/40s, which responded
to a 250cc bolus. She was started on vancomcyin, meropenem for
HAP treatment, hydrocortisone for mild COPD flare and relative
adrenal insufficiency, and kayaxalate for hyperkalemia. Bipap
was started overnight for her known OSA.
.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2198-8-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Little change from prior with continued pulmonary
vascular
congestion, bibasilar airspace opacities suggestive of
atelectasis and
probable small left pleural effusion. Please note that infection
within the lung bases cannot be excluded on this exam.
Enlargement of the hila
bilaterally is suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension.

CXR [**2198-8-18**]:
CHEST: There has been no significant change since the prior
chest x-ray of
[**8-17**]. Bibasilar consolidations are again noted with bilateral
effusions. Appearances are consistent with failure and possibly
additional pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: No change. Failure and possible pneumonia.

[**8-19**] CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST
FINDINGS: there is a large nodule in the left lobe of the
thyroid gland measuring 3.2 x 2.4 cm. This contains coarse
calficiations but is unchanged in appearance compared to the
prior study. No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is seen.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and
coronary arteries is seen. Calcification of the mitral valve
annulus is also noted. A left-sided subclavian line is in situ
with its tip at the distal SVC. The heart is moderately enlarged
but unchanged compared to the prior study. No axillary or
mediastinal lymph nodes which meet the CT size criteria for
pathologic enlargement. There is a cluster of small mediastinal
lymph nodes in a pretracheal and precarinal position (2:17, 10).
These are similar in appearance compared to the prior study.
There are bilateral small simple pleural effusions with
associated compressive atelectasis. There is near-complete
atelectasis of the left lower lobe. Assessment for associated
infection is limited by the lack of intravenous contrast. The
main pulmonary artery measures 4.6 cm, increased in size
compared to the prior study when it measured 4.2 cm. In addition
the right main pulmonary artery measures 3.4 cm, increased from
2.9 cm and the left main pulmonary artery measures 3.1 cm,
increased from 2.7 cm. There is prominence of th intrapulmonary
vasculature also consistent with the patient's known pulmonary
hypertension. There is persistent bronchiectasis in the right
upper lobe (2:21). This has not progressed compared to the prior
study. No other focal abnormalities are seen. An endotracheal
tube is in situ with its tip approximately 2cm proximal to the
carina. The airways are patent to subsegmental level. This study
s
not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic organs, only
to note there is a small amount of perihepatic simple free
fluid. An NG tube lies with its tip in the stomach. The right
adrenal gland is unremarkable. The left adrenal gland is not
clearly seen.
BONY STRUCTURES: no destructive lytic or sclerotic bony lesions
are seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be
excluded.
2. Persistent pulmonary hypertension with disease progression.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions not sufficient to account
for the left lower lobe atelectasis.
4. Trace ascites.
5. Cardiomegaly.
6. Atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch, coronary
arteries and
mitral valve annulus.

[**8-20**] Cardiac cath

COMMENTS:
1.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severely-elevated left-sided
filling
pressures with a mean wedge pressure of 40mmHg,
moderately-elevated
right-sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 18, and

moderate pulmonary hypertension with a mean PA pressure of 44.
The patient's cardiac index was perserved.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.


GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Resting tachycardia
(HR>100bpm). Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions

with preserved systolic function. Moderately dilated RV with
borderline systolic function. Moderate to severe moderate
tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior report dated [**2198-7-27**] (images
reviewed), the degree of aortic stenosis is now quantified and
appears to be critical.

[**2198-8-28**] CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Unchanged course and position of the left-sided PICC
line. Unchanged cardiomegaly with signs of moderate pulmonary
edema. Unchanged bilateral basal opacities, left more than
right, that are probably atelectatic in origin. The presence of
small pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No newly appeared
focal parenchymal abnormalities.

[**8-26**] CXR
Left PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC. Cardiomegaly
is present, including severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient
continues to be in pulmonary edema. Right lower lobe opacity is
persistent and might reflect gradual progression of infectious
process. Bilateral pleural effusions are redemonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with a history of COPD on
home O2 2-4LNC, bronchiechtasis with multiple recurrent
pneumonias, diastolic heart failure, atrial fib not on coumadin,
aortic stenosis s/p balloon valvuloplasty [**4-/2198**] who presents
with acute shortness of breath and productive [**Year (4 digits) **].

1. Respiratory failure: Patient presented initially to the ICU
with clinical and ABG evidence of hypercarbic respiratory
failure that improved with bipap however ultimately she
necessitated intubation. Etiology was ? multifactorial including
HCAP (has history of mutliple recurrent PNA's, and both sputum
and BAL grew out a resistant Pseudomonas, see below), pulmonary
edema from severe AS (see below) and uncontrolled atrial
fibrillation), and COPD exacerbation.

She was treated with IV diuresis and was about 13L negative
through LOS; this was occasionally limited by low blood
pressures. She was treated with bronchodilators and steroids,
which are currently being weaned off (currently at 20 mg daily,
switch to 10 mg daily on [**8-30**] for 3 days, and should go down to
5mg indefinitely thereafter until Pulmonology f/u. Of note, pt
is on Dapsone for PCP prophylaxis which could be stopped once pt
is weaned down to 5mg daily Prednisone.

Most importantly, while intubated pt had TEE (55%, significant
calcific AS, dilated RV with borderline systolic fxn, 1+ MR, 2+
TR) and TTE (65-70%, critical AS, mild AR, RV as above, 3+ TR,
severe pulmHTN -> AS now critical) and pt then underwent cardiac
cathterization which confirmed severe AS. Swan Ganz catheter was
placed which showed PCWP's in the 40's, and PAP 60/40, at which
point pt was started on IV Lasix gtt guided by Swan. She then
underwent aortic valvuloplasty which did improve her transaortic
gradient from mid 50's to low 30's. She was diuresed with IV
Lasix gtt and was 13L negative by discharge and last measured
PCWP was 14. She was also given 3d of Acetazolamide for elevated
HCO3.

Pt was evaluated by Cardiology and CSurg for evaluated of aortic
valve replacement vs research protocol transarterial aortic
valve replacement. This workup was ongoing and pt has follow up
scheduled for [**9-5**] with CSurg, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].

Pt was eventually weaned from ventilator and extubated without
difficulty. She was weaned down to 2L NC by discharge, and
should receive BiPAP at night. Her Lasix gtt was off by
discharge however she was discharged just before transitioning
her to PO diuresis which she was taking before admission (60 mg
in the am and 20 mg in the pm, and 50 mg daily Spironolactone).
She was placed back on torsemide prior to discharge. Patient
will need daily evaluation of fluid status with goal for further
diuresis of 1L if BP/HR tolerate and patient not symptomatic.

2. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PNA: ID consulted, unclear if this was
colonization vs active PNA, however given pt with acute on
chronic respiratory failure, ID was consulted and recommended
treatment with a 14d course of Merrem (was intermediate to
Merrem and resistant to basically everything else). Her last
dose of Merrem should be around 8pm of [**8-28**] which will be given
at LTAC. She was also empirically treated with a course of
Vancomycin until her WBC count and Plts began to drop; at which
point this was stopped and only continued on Meropenem without
any change in clincal status. A 14 day course of meropenem was
completed at the recommendation of ID.

3. Hypotension: Initially during presentation; this responded
with IVF's. This was early in her course and not further
clinically relevant, she was never on pressors.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 1.8 on admission, up from
baseline of 1.2-1.3. Unclear etiology, possibly due to poor
forward flow from severe AS. This improved slowly with diuresis
and pt's Cr was 0.7-0.8 by discharge.

5. Atrial fibrillation: Rate well controlled not on
anticoagulation [**3-7**] bleed history. She was noted to have rapid
ventricular rate, and was initially on Diltiazem gtt that was
transition to oral Diltiazem which provided good rate control
and should be continued. Continued on ASA 325mg daily. However,
she continued to have fast rates, requiring dilt gtt.

6. OSA: Reports 100% adherence. She was given nocturnal BiPAP
after extubation.

7. Leukopenia: This has been previously noted, with Heme Onc
consultation note in [**2193**]. Her WBC 4.7 on admission decreased to
trough of 1.5 which was thought possibly due to Vancomycin, and
so this was stopped without any clinical deterioration and
Vancomycin was added to her allergy list for ? leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia.

8. Anemia: Hct 31.4 on admission trended down through admission
to 26.9 on discharge. She was not transfused. Iron studies
consistent with iron deficiency anemia however supplementation
was deferred to outpatient providers. Of note patient had
heme-positive stool throughout admission.

9. Thrombocytopenia: Plts 170 on admission, trended down to 135
through admission, possibly also thought due to Vancomycin. On
discharge, plts remained 135.

10. Follow up issues: She will need to follow up with Cardiology
(Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]), CSurg (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], Pulmonology (has not
seen in 1.5 yrs due to cancelling appts), Sleep medicine (Dr.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname **].

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You came in to [**Hospital1 18**] for
increase in SOB and respiratory distress. You had to be
intubated (have a tube placed to help you breath). Your
respiratory failure was thought to be due to numerous causes:
COPD, heart failure, valve stenosis and pseudomonas pneumonia.
You were treated for all of these with antibiotics for the
pneumonia, IV lasix (diuretics) for  your heart failure and you
also had a balloon valvuloplasty for your aortic valve stenosis.
You are also in the process of being evaluated by
cardio-thoracic surgery for possible valve replacement surgery.
You have done well and you were able to be extubated with no
complications. You are now breathing more comfortable on [**3-8**]
Liters of oxygen via nasal canula. You will need to have
follow-up appointments with the cardio-thoracic surgeon and
pulmonologist as listed below.

The following changes were made to your medications:
- Meropenem 1000 mg IV every 8 hours (last dose tonight on
[**8-28**])
- Restart Torsimide home dose 60mg every AM and 20mg every PM,
start tomorrow and adjust as needed
- Spirolactone 50mg orally daily
- Dapsone until prednisone is [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] down to 5mg daily then stop
- Diltiazem changed from 240mg Extended release daily to 60 mg
PO/NG TID (it may be increase as tolerated)
- Start on insulin, Humolog Sliding scale while on prednisone
- Prednisone 20mg orally until [**8-29**], then decrease to 10mg for
3 days (from [**Date range (1) 111101**]) and 5mg daily (from [**9-2**])

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

Service:

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right common carotid artery stenosis.
2.  Right brachiocephalic artery occlusion.
3   Right arm ischemia

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Aorto to right common
carotid bypass and right CEA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 64-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease as well as extensive peripheral vascular
disease who was admitted to the [**Hospital6 2018**] on [**2139-3-27**] for an elective  aortic arch to carotid
bypass surgery.

The patient was admitted because as an outpatient she had
been on Coumadin and the plan for her was to be converted to
a Heparin drip prior to her surgery.  Of note, the patient
has undergone a catheterization in [**12/2138**] which demonstrated
that the brachiocephalic artery was occluded just before the
origin of the right common carotid artery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with occlusion of the right
coronary artery.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease.
3.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
4.  Renal artery stenosis.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Peptic ulcer disease.
9.  History of gastrointestinal bleed.
10. Chronic renal insufficiency.
11. History of Methicillin-resistant enterococcal urinary
tract infection.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left subclavian artery stent.
2.  Left carotid artery stent.
3.  Left subclavian artery stent.
4.  Aortofemoral bypass.
5.  Left renal artery stent

MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
3.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. daily.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg daily.
5.  Lipitor 40 mg daily.
6.  Isosorbide dinitrate 30 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. daily.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. daily.
9.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily.
10. Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q. h.s.

ALLERGIES:  Patient had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient had a 30-pack-year smoking history
and quit three years prior to admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake and alert.  Temperature
98.3, heart rate 54, blood pressure 120/76, respiratory rate
14, satting 93% on room air.  Her HEENT exam demonstrates her
head to be normocephalic and atraumatic with her extraocular
muscles intact and anicteric sclerae and a left carotid
bruit.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Her lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart sounds are regular
in rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop
appreciated.  The abdomen is soft, obese, nontender,
nondistended.  There is trace edema noted.

LABORATORY EVALUATION AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell
count of 5.6, hematocrit 34.5, platelets of 170, sodium of
144, potassium of 4.3, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 28,
BUN of 40, creatinine of 2.7, and glucose of 99.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 64-year-old female with a
history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease with a demonstrated brachiocephalic artery occlusion
who is now presenting for elective bypass of this occlusion.

Patient was admitted, placed on a Heparin drip with a
Cardiology evaluation, and preoperative clearance given.  She
was taken to the Operating Room on [**2139-3-30**] when the bypass
was performed without incident.  Patient had Dopplerable
triphasic brachial, radial, and ulnar pulses postoperatively.
She was in the Cardiothoracic Surgery Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively.

Her postoperative course was initially stable.  She was
weaned off of her pressors and continued on antibiotics.

By postoperative day number two she had been extubated and
was neurologically intact and transferred to the Vascular
Intermediate Care Unit.  A Physical Therapy consultation was
obtained for postoperative recovery.  Patient was resumed on
her Coumadin as well as her preadmission medication regimen.
Of note, the patient developed atrial fibrillation on
[**2139-4-1**] which was rate controlled with Lopressor.  Her
Amiodarone dose was increased and this continued to control
her rate.

Patient, on the evening of [**2139-4-4**], developed respiratory
distress and arrest which led to a cardiac arrest.  She was
emergently intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit.

During the code she developed asystole.  Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation was initiated and tracings at that time showed
fine ventricular fibrillation.  She was successfully
defibrillated and developed an organized rhythm.  Her EKG
demonstrated diffuse ST segment ischemic changes.  Her blood
pressure returned to 110/68 and she was seen by the
cardiologist.

The patient required Dopamine drip to maintain her blood
pressure which was changed to Levophed.  She underwent a
bronchoscopy which demonstrated some areas of atelectasis but
otherwise without acute pathology.

A PA catheter was placed which initially was unable to be
wedged but demonstrated a central venous pressure of 15, PA
pressures of 35/12, and a cardiac output and index of 4.8 and
1.9, respectively.  The SVR was 833 at that time and the
Levophed drip was running at 0.02 mcg/kg per minute at that
time.

A TEE was emergently performed which demonstrated normal
biventricular function and no evidence of dissection.  A
chest x-ray that had been done at the time of the code
demonstrated left basilar collapse, for which the
bronchoscopy was performed.

The patient was continued on her Heparin with full supportive
Intensive Care Unit care.  However, after extensive
discussions with the family members it was decided that the
patient would no longer want to have full supportive care
given her grave prognosis following her cardiopulmonary
arrest.  With this in mind the family made a decision to not
have the patient undergo any additional diagnostic testing or
therapeutic interventions.  They requested that the level of
support not be escalated or withdrawn, that is, that her
current level of support that was being delivered on
[**2139-4-5**] be continued without change.

Patient remained comfortable and became asystolic on the
morning of /  / and was pronounced by the Intensive Care Unit
team at that time.  The medical examiner was notified by the
Intensive Care Unit team.

Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurological exam:  Alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII intact.  No focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood count 16.2,
hemoglobin 15.7, hematocrit 45.5, platelets 298.  INR 1.1,
PTT 26.6.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 100,

IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 68-year-old male with long standing
tobacco use likely with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
now exacerbation possibly with overlying congestive heart
failure admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  Patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent
nebs as well as given a dose of Lasix in the Emergency
Department as well as IV Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV times one in
the Emergency Department and was started on C-PAP.  He was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  While there,
he was continued on nebulizers as well as IV Solu-Medrol with
significant improvement in his respiratory status with blood
gas returning to 7.39 with pCO2 down to 41 and pO2 at 99,
bicarbonate 26 within several hours of admission into the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The Solu-Medrol was switched to
Prednisone and the nebs were switched to p.r.n. then switched
to a MDI.

The following day the patient was transferred to the Medical
Floor where he was breathing significantly better.  He was
started on Erythromycin p.o. for antibiotic coverage for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and on
discharge patient is saturating at 95 to 96% on room air in
no respiratory distress.  He will be continued on a
Prednisone taper as an outpatient as well as Albuterol and
Atrovent MDIs.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Patient was noted to have rales on exam
and responded well to Lasix.  He was noted to have a
depressed ejection fraction on an echocardiogram that was
done on [**12-23**].  Ejection fraction was less than 20%
with global left ventricular hypokinesis.  Etiology at this
point is unclear, however it will warrant an outpatient
evaluation including possible work up for coronary artery
disease, however on admission, the patient was ruled out for
myocardial infarction by enzymes with no events on Telemetry.
Etiology may likely be alcohol related cardiomyopathy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Cardiomyopathy, unclear etiology.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  Patient is saturating well on
room air and is to be discharged home with follow up with the
primary care physician which will be set in the [**Hospital 191**] Clinic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 60 mg p.o. q. day for three days post
discharge, no taper.
2.  Erythromycin 500 mg p.o. q. day times four days.
3.  Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs.
4.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2157-2-21**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.


[**2156-12-10**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**9-23**], there is
continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of
elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No acute focal pneumonia. On
the lateral view, there appears to be some opacification in the
retrocardiac area. However, some of this may be merely due to
overlying soft tissues. In view of the clinical history, the
possibility of a region of pneumonia cannot be excluded.

[**2156-12-10**] Left wrist x-ray: Soft tissue calcifications and
swelling overlying the radial aspect of the distal radius are
grossly stable since [**2156-3-3**]. The scapholunate interval again
measures 3 mm. Diffuse osteopenia is unchanged. Lucencies are
noted within the capitate and scaphoid which are grossly stable.
There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment.
IMPRESSION: Stable exam without evidence of acute process

[**2156-12-11**] Right shoulder x-ray: No previous images. Three views
show loss of the cortical margin involving the distal clavicle
with widening of the acromioclavicular joint. Suggestion of an
associated soft tissue prominence. In view of the clinical
history, the possibility of a septic arthritis with
osteomyelitis must be seriously considered.

[**2156-12-12**] CT head (prelim report): No evidence of acute
intracranial abnormality seen on non-contrast head CT, although
for more sensitive evaluation for subtle intracranial infection
or small acute infarct, MRI would be recommended for more
sensitive evaluation. Diffuse small lucencies in the calvarium,
particularly along the vertex, without cortical breakthrough or
cortical thickening likely relates to chronic renal
failure/renal osteodystrophy, less likely Paget's disease or
diffuse metastatic disease.

[**2156-12-13**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. Compared with
the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2148-9-20**], the right ventricular cavity dilation and
moderate/severe PA systolic hypertension are new. The
pericardial effusion is likely similar.

[**2156-12-13**] Portable abdomen:Non-specific bowel gas pattern without
evidence for obstruction or ileus. No intraperitoneal free air.

[**2156-12-13**] MRI head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or
infarction. There is no evidence of mass effect. There are no
diffusion abnormalities detected, that would be suggestive of
septic emboli. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber
and configuration. There is noted to be fluid in the left
petrous apex. There are a few small hyperintense foci seen in
the white matter on FLAIR images that are non specific in nature
and demonstrate no restricted diffusion. The patient is noted to
be status post lens replacement on the right eyeglobe. In
comparison to the CT scan from [**2156-12-12**] the diffuse patchy and
small rounded lucencies in the calvarium are not well
demonstrated on this current MR study. The basilar artery is
noted to be small in diameter. There is noted to be opacity
within the mastoid air cells suggestive of fluid in the
mastoids. This could be suggestive of mastoiditis. IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for septic emboli or abscess. No acute infarction
or hemorrhage. 2. Areas of rounded lucencies within the
calvarium are not well demonstrated on this current MR study.
Please refer to CT report from [**2156-12-12**] for full
characterization. 3. There is noted to be fluid in the left
petrous apex.

[**2156-12-14**] Upper GI Endoscopy: Findings: Esophagus: Normal
esophagus. Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema and congestion of the
mucosa were noted in the whole stomach. Cold forceps biopsies
were performed for histology at the stomach antrum.  Duodenum:
Mucosa: Erythema, congestion and friability of the mucosa with
no bleeding were noted in the duodenal bulb compatible with
duodenitis.  Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding, clean
based, small ulcers were found in the duodenal bulb.
Impression: Ulcers in the duodenal bulb. Erythema, congestion
and friability in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
Erythema and congestion in the whole stomach (biopsy) Otherwise
normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.

[**2156-12-14**] Pathology: Gastric Tissue Sample: Regeneration of
gastric pits suggestive of chemical gastropathy.

[**2156-12-14**] EKG: Primarily atrial fibrillation although there appear
to be some flutter waves in leads V1-V2. Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Left anterior  fascicular
block. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy. Consider prior
lateral myocardial infarction. Non specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-12-14**] the rhythm is more
irregular consistent with atrial fibrillation.

[**2156-12-14**] U/S of L AV fistula: Widely patent left brachial and
left radial arteries with suggestion of some degree of
atherosclerotic disease. Widely patent radiocephalic fistula
without visualized stenosis of the outflow vein which appears to
be the cephalic vein.

[**2156-12-16**]: MRI of the R hip: There is small amount of joint fluid
in the right hip, which is in the range for physiological
quantity. There are degenerative changes in the right hip which
include subchondral cystic changes in the femoral head. A
subchondral cystic change is also noted in the femoral head-neck
junction. Given the superior joint space narrowing, the
appearance favors degenerative changes. However, less likely
infection may also produce this appearance. Infection is
considered less likely due to lack of joint fluid.
There is a lobulated bright T2 signal intensity lesion adjacent
to the superior labrum measuring 2.8 x 2.0 cm, which is most
consistent with a paralabral cyst. The labrum is not well
assessed on this non-dedicated examination.
There is fluid signal intensity which spans 10 cm along the
greater trochanteric bursa, and measures 5.8 x 1.6 cm in axial
dimensions, with appearance consistent with right greater
trochanteric bursitis. Degenerative changes are also noted in
the left hip. There is physiological joint fluid in the left
hip. A tiny amount of fluid is also noted in the left greater
trochanteric bursa, consistent with mild bursitis.
There is diffuse soft tissue edema. There is edema in the right
hemipelvis greater than left hemipelvis musculature,
particularly in the iliacus and gluteus minimus.
IMPRESSION:
Physiological quantity of right hip joint fluid. Insufficient
fluid for aspiration.   Greater trochanteric bursitis, right
side significantly greater than left. Presence of a paralabral
cyst suggests a superior labral tear, but the exact tear this is
not optimally seen due to lack of dedicated technique. Muscular
edema as detailed.

[**2156-12-18**]: CT Guided Biopsy: 25 cc of red serosanguineous colored
fluid was aspirated with no complication fluid was sent for
microbiologic examination. Culture:  GRAM STAIN 4+(>10 per 1000X
FIELD): POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES. NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2156-12-21**]):    NO GROWTH.

[**2156-12-21**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular
response. Occasional ventricular premature beats. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2156-12-16**] ectopy is new.

[**2156-12-21**]: CT of the torso, abdomen and pelvis to r/o occult
abscess: 1. Mild pulmonary edema and background nodular and
cystic changes, again concerning for LIP (lymphocytic
interstitial pneumonitis).   2. Unchanged marked cardiomegaly
and small-to-moderate-sized pericardial effusion. 3. Small
splenic infarct, age indeterminate due to lack of prior
examinations. 4. No evidence of intrathoracic or intra-abdominal
abscess.

[**2156-12-22**] TEE: Conclusions  The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened.There are torn, calcified mitral chordae
seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. Two eccentric (anterior
and posterior directed) jets of mitral regurgitation are seen
with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (3+) . A small
perforation of the posterior leaflet cannot be excluded on the
basis of this study. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve. There is a small pericardial effusion.
Impression: No valvular vegetations seen. Moderate to severe,
eccentric mitral regurgitation.

[**2156-12-23**]: CT of the L wrist: Innumerable lucencies are seen
throughout the carpus. This includes large ill-defined lucencies
in the scaphoid, lunate, capitate, hamate, trapezium,
triquetrum, and the bases of the metacarpals particularly the
second through fourth metacarpals. Numerous irregular lucencies
and areas of cortical destruction are also seen in the distal
ulna. There is extensive atherosclerotic vascular calcification.
Gas is seen within the dorsal soft tissues at the level of the
wrist likely related to previous incision and drainage. The
absence of intravenous contrast severely limits evaluation for
an underlying fluid collection, although no discrete soft tissue
density is identified. Circumferential soft tissue edema is seen
throughout the subcutaneous and deep fat as well as associated
skin thickening. Tendons are suboptimally assessed.
IMPRESSION:
1. Innumerable lucencies throughout the carpus, distal ulna, and
the bases of the metacarpals as described could reflect an
erosive process such as amyloidosis. However, given the history
and the destructive and ill-defined appearance of these
lucencies, the possibility of superimposed osteomyelitis is
difficult to exclude.
2. No discrete soft tissue collection, although evaluation is
suboptimal due to the absence of intravenous contrast.
3. Post-surgical changes including gas in the dorsal soft
tissues of the wrist.

[**2156-12-29**] EKG: Sinus rhythm and occasional ventricular ectopy.
A-V conduction delay. Left atrial abnormality. Right
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2156-12-20**] sinus rhythm has appeared.

[**2156-12-31**] CXR: Comparison is made to the prior chest x-ray of
[**12-13**]. The heart remains enlarged. Some pulmonary
plethora is present suggesting incipient failure. No areas of
pneumonia are seen. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, mild failure

[**2157-1-2**] MRI right hip:
1. Interval increase in the amount of right hip joint fluid, now
large in quantity.
2. More conspicuous signal changes in the right femoral head and
neck and diaphysis, likely representing components of mild
marrow edema and hematopoietic marrow.
3. Persistent, but slightly decreased, right greater
trochanteric bursitis.
4. Persistent, and slightly increased, diffuse muscle edema as
detailed.

[**2157-1-6**] CXR
1) Marked cardiomegaly consistent with polychamber enlargement
and/or an element of pericardial fluid.
2) Diffusely increased interstitial markings consistent with
interstitial edema or another interstial process, (Please note
that the report from the [**2156-12-21**] CT scan also raised concern
for a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis.)
2) Compared with [**2156-12-31**] and allowing for technical
differences, the interstitial markings are without significant
interval change. No pleural effusion.

Left-Wrist x-ray [**2157-2-11**]:
Diffuse osteoporosis is again seen, worse than on the prior
occasion. Soft tissue vascular calcification is again seen, and
also is present on the thenar aspect of the forearm. No definite
areas of bony destruction are seen; though, there is some
irregularity at the distal aspect of the scaphoid on the thenar
aspect. These films should be compared with the MR films by
musculoskeletal radiologist.

CT abd/pelvis [**2157-2-13**]:
1. Small pelvic fluid collections noted on prior studies are
less conspicuous on current study. No drainable fluid
collections are identified within the pelvis, although
evaluation limited given streak artifact from right hip
arthroplasty.
2. Little change to stranding and fluid within the region of the
right gluteal musculature after hip arthroplasty.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
Smooth septal
thickening within the bases again may represent pulmonary edema
superimposed on previously described lymphocytic interstitial
pneumonitis (LIP).
4. Cardiomegaly with mitral annular calcifications. Significant
calcifications within the SMA as detailed above.
5. Splenomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
""Brief""
This is a 59 year old male with ESRD on HD with persistent
fevers despite appropriate IV abx for MSSA+ bacteremia and
likely endocarditis following septic arthritis of left wrist s/p
wash-out.

# Fever: Vancomycin and gentamycin started empirically for joint
aspirate consistent with septic arthritis. Patient taken to OR
by plastic reconstructive surgery for wash-out of left wrist.
Blood cultures and fluid cultures subsequently grew out S.
aureus, and gentamycin discontinued. MSSA by [**Last Name (LF) 101016**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
vancomycin switched to nafcillin for better coverage, then to
cefazolin with hemodialysis. Drainage from left wrist noted to
be less purulent and less erythematous per PRS evaluation.
However, as Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to spike fevers with
persistently positive cultures, ID consulted and recommended
restarting on nafcillin. Pt continued spiking fevers although
cultures cleared [**12-12**]. Gentamicin with HD started for synergy.
Concern for endocarditis as pt with murmur at baseline and new
afib but no vegetations seen. No evidence of septic emboli on CT
and MRI head. X-ray to evaluate for right shoulder infection
with absent cortex likely [**3-14**] old trauma - pt later noted pain
old. Ultrasound of fistula with no evidence of infection.

Pt with pain on mobilization of R hip, concern for septic joint.
MRI with no evidence of hip joint involvement but showed fluid
collection at tronchanteric bursa (culture negative), labral
tear, muscle tear, improved with steroid injection. Left wrist
re-aspirated and showed rare S. aureus. Wrist re-imaged with CT
without significant fluid collection. TEE to re-evaluate for
vegetations showed increased mitral regurgitation with 2 jets
concerning for valve perforation as well as new aortic
regurgurgitation, both consistent with likely endocarditis. CT
surgery consulted and recommended surgery. Fevers continued
intermittently (at least 1 every 24hrs) along w/ development of
night sweats until [**12-27**].  Concern for nafcillin-related drug
fever, and patient switched to vancomycin with HD. Afebrile from
late [**12-27**] to [**12-30**], and Gentamicin discontinued. However,
continued to spike fevers on vancomycin and switched back to
beta-lactam for better coverage of MSSA but still continued to
spike fevers.

Treated for 8 wks w/ cefazolin for IE and wrist osteomyelitis.
Was temporarily afebrile, then broke R hip had hemiarthroplasty,
got ischemic colitis and hemicolectomy w/ ostomy. Ostomy leaked
into hip wound which became infected w/ enterobacter and
Klebsiella sensitive to cipro. Initially afebrile after starting
cipro and washing out hip. ID recommended continuing cipro for 6
months because of concern for infected prosthesis though ortho
said it was an infected hematoma. Recommended switching to
cefepime if he spiked a fever through the cipro. Over the
weekend of [**2-12**] and [**2-13**], the patient continued to spike low grade
fevers. Out of concern for continuuing infection, the patient
received a CT of the abd/pelvis on [**2157-2-13**]. This showed several
fluid collections and possibly a larger hematoma at the right
hip joint. The patient then had an IR guided drainage of fluid.
The hematoma near the joint did not aspirate and 100cc of fluid
collection near the staples was sampled. This fluid subsequently
grew VRE. It was determined the patient would need a Girdlestone
procedure in which the hardware of the right hip is removed and
replaced with a spacer so the area could be sterilized before
reinserting hardware. The patient went for this procedure on
[**2157-2-19**]. Post-op, the patient had a large amount of bloody
drainage from the wound vac and did requires an additional 10
units of pRBC's. After a brief stay in the MICU, the patient was
called out to the floor where he remained stable.

# Confusion: Pt initially delirious in setting of persistently
positive blood cultures and continuing fevers, improved back to
baseline 5-6d later when no longer bacteremic and fevers running
lower and more infrequent. Likely also to be more sensitive to
narcotics base on past response, per daughter. Of note, no acute
intracranial process on CT or MRI head. RPR neg. B12 wnl. TSH
elevated but T3 low, T4 wnl, likely euthyroid sick. Uremia
unlikely as lytes at baseline on HD. Now resolved and remains
AAO x 3 on discharge.

# Cardiac dysarrhythmia: On admission, EKG regular with
prolonged PR, unchanged from baseline. However, pt developed
Afib and occasional aflutter during hospital course. Initially
with RVR then associated with bradycardia into HR 30s-40s.
Evaluated by cardiology, who recommended anticoagulation with
coumadin and cardioversion. However, pt was not candidate at
that time as with new GI bleed, in which setting ASA also
discontinued. Pt remained hemodynamically stable. Now in Afib.
Would consider anticoagulation in the future if bleed is no
longer a concern.

# Cardiac/valvular disease: TTE on [**2156-12-13**] without vegetations,
trivial MR, no AI, normal EF. TEE on [**2156-12-12**] to re-evaluate for
vegetations showed increased mitral regurgitation w/ 2 jets
concerning for valve perforation as well as new aortic
regurgurgitation, both consistent with endocarditis. Restarted
on ACE I to decrease afterload. Evaluated by CT surgery who
recommended mitral and aortic replacement. Decision made by pt
and medical teams to defer in setting of acute infection while
aware that delay would increase risk of complications from
ongoing medical issues. Prior to surgery, pt will require cath
and dental clearance. At the time of surgery, a bypass will
likely be needed with renal transplant should follow. CT surgery
will remain in contact with the patient, scheduled to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**2157-1-18**]. Pt. remained in house [**3-14**]
complicated complications and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] saw him again in house
and recomended no valve surgery unless would go for renal
transplant, also too debilitated w/ infectious processes going
on [**2158-2-9**]. He was also given multiple blood transfusions out
of concern for demand ischemia.

# Elevated troponin: Likely baseline in setting of renal failure
although with transient worsening probably [**3-14**] to high output in
setting of infection. Sharp chest pain noted on several
occassions throughout stay, thought to be related to anxiety and
demand ischemia from MR, AI, and anemia. No EKG changes
appreciated with any episode; trop at baseline. Pain resolved
each time within several minutes and responded well to
nitroglycerin SL.

# CHF: Pt with chronic diastolic CHF and history of systolic CHF
(thought to be hypertensive cardiomyopathy) resolved on TTE in
[**2152**] but continued on digoxin and euvolemic on admission. As TTE
on this admission also showed normal EF and as digoxin levels
toxic in setting of delirium, digoxin discontinued; continued on
beta blocker. As pt complaining of increased angina, restarted
on ACE-I for afterload reduction. Repeat TTE after the diagnosis
of endocarditis with new finding of focal inferior wall motion
abnormality with EF of 45%, likely in setting of increased
valvular disease v. ischemic change. The patient was restarted
on digoxin. His Ace-I has since been discontinued and he is
being discharged on 12.5mg PO BID of Metoprolol.

# HTN: Continued on metoprolol. Initially held moexipril,
clonidine, and minoxidil as blood pressures lower running. As
these normalized, pt restarted on ACE-I (lisinopril) for
afterload reduction in setting of increased angina, though this
is now discontinued again. He is on Metoprolol for improved rate
control of afib as we are currently unable to anticoagulate him.

# Anemia: Patient was admitted w/ Hct of 38.5 which slowly
trended down over admission to a low of 19.4. Anemia thought to
be of combined etiology including GI bleed, frequent blood
draws, anemia of chronic disease (as supported by Fe studies),
and ESRD (on Epogen w/ HD).  Patient transfused with HD as Hct
dropped into low 20s as developed more frequent episodes CP and
SOB, likely exacerbated by valvular damage [**3-14**] endocarditis. The
patient is currently guaiac negative but if Hct continues to
trend down, may need outpt colonoscopy. Hct should be monitored
on discharge, even after his hip wound ceases to drain.

# Guaiac positive stools: Patient complained of abdominal
tenderness on [**12-12**] exam with voluntary guarding. LFTs wnl and
KUB unremarkable, date of last bowel movement unclear. Pt with
one large episode melanic stool on [**12-14**], EGD showed nonbleeding
duodenol ulcers, duodenitis. Pt started on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and home ASA
held. Stools no longer guaiac positive except in setting of
nosebleed, now again resolving.

# Ischemic colitis: Pt complained of increasing abdominal pain
during his HD session on [**1-13**]. Abdominal exam without guarding
or rebound but concern as pt appeared unwell, worsened from
baseline. Found to have ischemic colitis on stat CT. Surgery
consulted and pt taken to OR for left hemicolectomy and
transferred to the SICU afterwards. Post-op course notable for
some hypotension requiring blood transfusion and pressors.
However, remaining bowel appeared pink and no further bowel
resection required, and pt underwent abdominal closure,
ileostomy, Gtube placement on [**1-16**]. Extubated without difficulty
on [**1-17**]. Of note, wound vac placed on abdominal wound for caudal
aspect opening on [**1-25**]. The abdominal wound vac should be
replaced every 3 days until it can be discontinued.

# ESRD on HD: Patient s/p failed transplant, on transplant list
again. Between HD sessions, pt developed increased JVD and
bibasilar rales but breathing comfortably and satting well. Does
not produce urine at baseline. Continued on HD MWF, home meds,
medications renally dosed.

# Right shoulder pain: Pt complaining of right shoulder pain on
movement, concern for septic involvement initially. Xray showed
cortical absence at distal cortex, c/w old trauma v. infection.
However, as patient without point tenderness and no signs of
inflammation, low suspicion for infection. On further
questioning, pt reports having had pain on and off for few weeks
prior to presentation; per pt, it is possible he has sustained
trauma to that shoulder.

# Right hip fracture happened after bumping right knee on bed
rail on [**2157-1-10**]. Taken to the operating room on [**2157-1-11**] and
underwent an right hip hemiarthroplasty.  Unfortunately found to
have same hip dislocated on [**2157-1-25**].  Returned to the operating
room on [**2157-1-26**] and underwent a revision of his right
hemiarthroplasty.  He was found to have Enterococcus growing
from his wound on [**2157-2-17**].  He was taken back to the OR for
removal of the hardware on [**2157-2-18**].  At that time he was
coagulopathic with an INR of 1.8  He was transfered to the MICU
following the procedure as he became hypotensive.  He was found
to have profound blood loss into his hip joint.  He was
transfused a total of 10 units of PRBCs and 10 units of FFP at
taht time and 2 additional units of PRBCs the following day.  He
was stablized and monitored in the ICU until [**2157-2-22**] when he was
taken back to the OR for washout.  He was found to have VRE in
the wound and treated with daptomycin and ciprofloxacin.  He was
then transfered to the floor on the night of [**2157-2-22**].

Discharge Condition:
Stable. afebrile.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with an infected left wrist, which was
surgically cleaned.  The wrist and your blood cultures contained
bacteria, and therefore you were started on IV antibiotics.
These were changed several times during your stay here to
specifically target the bacteria.  Despite these antibiotics,
you remained febrile for several weeks and we were concerned for
infection in other parts of your body.  Imaging of your heart
showed evidence of infection, including new valve damage to your
mitral and aortic valves.  This makes it harder for your heart
to pump blood forwards and may require replacement of your heart
valves at a future date.  In addition, during your stay, you
were noted to have blood in your stool, found to be the result
of ulcers in your duodenum. You received several blood
transfusions during your hospital course.

While you were here, you broke your right hip and received a hip
replacement. Following this, you had ischemic colitis requiring
a hemicolectomy with ostomy placement. Subsequently, it was
found that your hip wound grew Klebsiella and Enterobacter. You
were treated for these but continued to have low grade fevers. A
CT scan showed continuing fluid collection near your hip. A
Girdlestone procedure was performed in which your hip hardware
was removed and a spacer placed. You will receive IV antibiotics
for the next several weeks for this. The bacteria which grew
from this wound is called VRE, which is a resistent bacteria
requiring special antiobiotics. You were also noted to have had
an small heart attack sometime during [**Month (only) **]. You do have a
history of atrial fibrillation for which you were previously
taking Coumadin, but this is currently being held.

1. You will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation facility
where you will have hemodialysis (HD) on your regular schedule.
Your antibiotics will also be continued.  At a follow-up
appointment with infectious disease, it will be determined the
exact length of antibiotic treatment.

2. If you become very short of breath or experience a
significant increase in the swelling in your legs, please let
the staff at the rehab facility know.  This can be a result of
your heart's pumping function.

3. Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2450**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 438**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
as below.

4. Do not take aspirin unless instructed to by a physician as
this can worsen your small intestinal bleed.

5. At rehab, the following labs should be checked:
- Hct once every day until stable, with transfusions at HD if
clinically appropriate.
- Guaiac stools

History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname 4643**] is a pleasant 87F with hx of intermittent vertigo on
Meclizine, afib on coumadin, recent UTI tx'd with bactrim, now
presenting to the ED for vertigo.  Pt states that 4 days ago she
noticed hematuria, which prompted her to go to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] which
point she was given bactrim for a UTI.  She never had dysuria or
frequency.  Today she felt vertiginous and lightheaded and
therefore presented to the ED.  Pt states that he vertigo comes
on out of the blue, is not positional or worse with changing
positions.  She states that she feels thirsty but has had normal
PO intake over the last several days.  Of note, her UA from 4 d
PTA showed leuks, blood, few bacteria, creatinine was 0.87.
Urine cx showed mixed gram positive flora.

In the ED inital vitals were 98.7 60 92/68 (b/l 120/80) 18 100%
10L Non-Rebreather, which was rapidly weaned.  Venous gas showed
7.26/48/51.  Triggered for hypotension (reportedly 50/30),
central line placed, pt given 500 ccs NS, bedside echo showed
adequate pump funx, no effusion.  CVP reportedly 22.  Labs were
notable for lactate of 5.3, creatinine 1.9, gap of 16.  She was
given zofran, levofloxacin for possible PNA, and started on a
norepi gtt for hypotension.  CXR showed central venous catheter
terminating at the cavoatrial junction, mild pulmonary vascular
congestion, l-sided pleural effusion.  Line was pulled back.
BPs improved to 100s, no O2 requirement.  VItals on transfer
were 98.7 64 17 97/67 100% on 2L NC.

On arrival to the ICU, pt is comfortable.  She states that her
breathing is slightly labored however she denies SOB, cough, CP.
 She does feel slightly nauseous and weak all over.  She does
not currently feel vertiginous, however states that it comes on
suddenly and she was recently feeling nauseous.

Imaging:
[**2177-3-1**] CXR: Persistent low lung volume. Pulmonary edema has
resolved. Pacer leads are in standard position. Right IJ
catheter tip is in the upper right atrium. There is no evident
pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. Bibasilar
atelectases have improved on the left.

[**2177-3-1**] TTE (Focused views): IMPRESSION: Limited transthoracic
echocardiography. Unable to assess regional wall motion
abnormalities due to limited study, but overall systolic
function of the left ventricle is probably normal. Severe
tricuspid regurgitation with failure of tricuspid leaflet
coaptation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Unable to fully assess
aortic valve.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2173-4-12**], the tricuspid regurgitation
is now severe. If clinically indicated, a complete transthoracic
examination with Doppler is recommended.

[**2177-3-4**] Portable TTE: Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2177-3-1**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is now higher.

[**2177-3-2**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) :
1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Patent portal vein. Prominent hepatic veins likely due to
vascular
congestion.
3. Possible right renal fullness seen on partial views of right
kidney. If
indicated, this could be evaluated with renal ultrasound.

Renal U/s [**2177-3-12**]: Somewhat limited study however both kidneys
are within normal limits with good cortical thickness, no
hydronephrosis or mass lesions identified.  The bladder is fully
decompressed around the Foley catheter.

[**2177-3-17**] CXR: Central venous catheter and permanent pacemaker
remain unchanged in position allowing for positional differences
of the patient. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, accompanied by
pulmonary vascular engorgement. Previously reported multifocal
pulmonary opacities have partially cleared with residual
opacities mostly in the perihilar regions. This likely reflects
improving pulmonary edema. More confluent opacity in left
retrocardiac region has only slightly improved and is likely due
to a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Small right
pleural effusion has decreased in size.

[**2177-3-17**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular
response. Intermittent pacer spikes which do not capture
non-specific anterior and inferior ST-T wave changes. Modest Q-T
interval prolongation. Compared to tracing #1 ventricular paced
beats are absent. Anterior ST-T wave changes are more
pronounced. Clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: Pleasant 87 yo female presenting with
dizziness, hypotension concerning for sepsis initially requiring
pressors in the ICU, who was then called out to the cardiology
service with volume overload, AFIB  and severe TR w/ RV
dilation. Underwent DCCV but continued to be in afib and had to
be transferred to the CCU for respiratory distress where she was
diuresed and then transferred back to the cardiology floor. She
was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] (LTAC).

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Septic Shock: The pt was hypotensive on admission requiring
pressors with signs of end organ damage including acute renal
failure and shock liver.  Lactate was 5.3 on admission and rose
rapidly throughout her first day in the ICU peaking at 9.  The
pt had a recent hx of UTI and there was a concern for urosepsis,
so she was started on broad antibiotics with vancomycin and
zosyn and receieved a 7 day course. On exam, however, she was
cold and clamped down peripherally, more concerning for a
cardiogenic process.  Additionally, ECG was showing only
intermittent capture of pacemaker. Cardiology/EP was consulted,
and her pacemaker was interrogated and adjusted to improve
cardiac output in setting of shock and acidosis (see Atrial
Fibrillation below). Echo was then obtained, which showed severe
tricuspid regurgitation with complete lack of coaptation of
tricuspid leaflets.  It was thought that this was likely the
cause of her shock, in addition to the infectious component that
had instigated her acute presentation (although no infectious
source was isolated during her hospital course). Therefore she
was gently diruresed with IV lasix back to her dry weight. She
continued to have intermittent respiratory difficulty likely [**3-6**]
COPD and fluid overload, which was alleviated with nebs and IV
lasix.

# Atrial fibrillation:  On coumadin, supratherapeutic INR on
admission (see below). EKG initially showed intermittent pacing
with evidence of pacer spikes on t-waves.  Cardiology/EP consult
was obtained, and on pacemaker interrogation was noted to have
elevated thresholds above programmed output of leads leading to
intermittent capture. PPM was reprogrammed with higher output
and higher HR to 80s with appropriate capture. HR was increased
to improve cardiac output to more closely match physiologic
demand in setting of shock. She was started on dofetilide, but
this was discontinued due to QT prolongation.  She was then
started on amiodarone and metoprolol.  In the ICU, verapamil was
increased to 60mg TID and metoprolol was maintained at 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
 In this setting, home lisinopril was held to give blood
pressure room. However, the pt has a hx of not tolerating Amio
which was dc/ed and the pt underwent DCCV after transfer to the
floor. However, pt reverted back to AFIB and had to go to the
CCU for resp distress. QT prolongation prevented dofelitide from
being continued, and metoprolol was dc/ed as it was thought to
be worsening bronchospasm. At the time of discharge she was put
on a higher dose of verapamil (280 [**Hospital1 **]). DCCV was performed
again and she continued to be in afib. Flecainide was dc/ed due
to likely underlying CAD and was switched to digoxin 0.125 every
other day. However, dig was also dc/ed and the pt was dc/ed on
verapamil alone with HR in 70s and 80s. The pacemaker was
changed from DDIR to VVI w/ a lower HR threshold of 50 bpm.

# Acute renal failure:  Creatinine elevated to 1.9 on
presentation, up from previous baseline of 0.7-0.8 one year
prior.  Etiology thought to be ATN vs hypotension/shock. Her
initial course was complicated by hyperkalemia with associated
widening of QRS and [**Last Name (LF) 5937**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given kayexalate, insulin +
D50, and calcium gluconate.  Creatinine peaked at 2.9 with
minimal urine output, however renal function improved with
continued fluid resuscitation and support with pressors. Towards
the end of her stay she had another Cr spike (1.8 from 1.1)
which improved with gentle fluid resusciation. Her Cr at dc was
1.5.

# Dyspnea: Patient became acutely dyspneic after cardioversion
from Afib.  She was transferred to the CCU for closer
monitoring.  In the CCU, she was placed on a nitro gtt and
diuresed with lasix boluses. Her SOB was however multifactorial
but primarily d/t fluid overload vs COPD vs severe thoracic
kyphosis as she responded to both lasix and nebs. She was also
started on Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus (500/50). Torsemide was
started for po diuresis as she failed po lasix diuresis.
Lisinopril was restarted at 5mg. Her 02 requirement went up to
3L but she was comfortable on RA on dc. At discharge she was
stable on RA but patient prone to having acute episodes of
dyspnea that were alleviated with duonebs and IV lasix 40mg (if
the pt appeared overloaded on exam).

# Fluctuating INR: Pt presented on coumadin for Afib (INR goal
[**3-7**]); INR 3.5 on presentation in the ED but rapidly rose to 6.2
upon arrival in the ICU.  Peaked at 9.7.  No signs of bleeding,
so she was not given any reveral agents.  Etiology of acute rise
presumed to be liver dysfunction in the setting of
hypotension/shock. However, pt has a hx of labile INR. Recieved
Vitamin K in the CCU and had hematuria which persisted a few
days after resolution of supratherpeutic INR. She was bridged
back to therapeutic range with lovenox. INR managment remained
challenging throughout her stay. At the time of dc her INR was
3.5 so her coumadin of 0.5 mg was held.

# Hematuria: pt continued to have gross hematuria. Unrelated to
INR levels. Was worked up in the past w/ cystoscopy showing
bilateral diverticuli. She has been set up for follow up appt
with urologist for cystoscopy. Renal u/s done here was normal.

# Transaminitis:  AST/ALT in the 400s on presentation, likely
due to acute injury from hypoperfusion (shock liver) vs.
congestive hepatopathy.  Alkaline phosphatase and bili remained
within normal limits, supports this hypothesis.  Transaminases
rose to the thousands prior to coming down after resolution of
sepsis.

# Anemia: Normocytic, near recent baseline of 34.3 on
presentation.  Despite high INR, no signs of acute bleedn other
than known prior hematuria that continued intermittently
througout her stay.  Likely [**3-6**] chronic hematuria vs low marrow
production. Her retic count was normal, and SPEP was also
normal.

INACTIVE ISSUES:

# Dementia: stable; contined home meds mirtazepine and aricept

# GERD: continue home ranitidine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Patient has a variety of specialist appts
that need to be followed up with. In case that she develops
dyspnea and does not respond to duonebs, IV lasix 40mg should be
given. Verapamil dose can be increased to 240 [**Hospital1 **] if rate
control or blood pressure managment becomes problem[**Name (NI) 115**]. Pt's
INR on the day of DC was 3.5 so her warfarin dose of 0.5 mg was
held. Please restart warfarin at 1 mg after the INR is in
therapuetic range.

obstruction.

Initial management in the MICU. Family declined surgery but
wanted to continue aggressive medical management of her
condition. The patient was maintained on IVF and her abdominal
exam improved. The NGT was removed and the patient was
transferred to the floor after starting po intake.  The morning
after transfer, she again became distended, developed pain and
began vomiting.  The NGT was replaced with 850 cc immediate
output. She was kept NPO/NGT/IVF for several days with no
improvement in her symptoms.  Extensive discussions were had
with the family regarding her unresolving SBO and the daughter
wanted to continue aggressive care. She became volume overloaded
while on IVF, so the fluid was d/c'ed as it was no longer
medically indicated. Output from her NGT stopped, so her NGT was
d/c'ed. She was kept comfortable and passed away.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old
gentleman with class IVb pulmonary artery hypertension
(secondary to scleroderma) and also with congestive heart
failure with diastolic dysfunction (last ejection fraction
was 55%) who was admitted to the hospital for a cardiac
catheterization and titration of his Flolan for worsening
shortness of breath over the past week despite an increase in
his Flolan dose as an outpatient.

The cardiac catheterization showed elevated pulmonary artery
pressures of 69/12.  His wedge was 27.  There was no evidence
of effusion.  He had normal right-sided and left-sided
filling pressures.  This increase in his pulmonary
hypertension had increased since his last catheterization.
His cardiac output was preserved at 5.52; which was slightly
reduced since his previous cardiac catheterization.

His recent outpatient workup for this worsening shortness of
breath had included a computed tomography scan of his lungs
which showed that he had an increasing right pleural
effusion.  An echocardiogram showed no changed from previous,
and there had been a question of dietary indiscretion.
Recently, his outpatient diuretic regimen had been increased.
On admission, his creatinine was 2.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems revealed no fevers or
chills.  No chest pain.  Shortness of breath as noted above.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Scleroderma.
 2.  Pulmonary hypertension on Flolan since [**2139-5-21**].
 3.  He also has a history of pleural effusion on the right.
 4.  History of hypocalcemia.
 5.  History of chest wall cellulitis.
 6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 7.  History of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
 8.  Status post turbinectomy.
 9.  Status post venous stripping.
10.  Hypertension.
11.  History of neck pain; question migraines.
12.  History of low back pain.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Flolan 21 ng/kg/min.
 2.  Bumex 4 mg by mouth twice per day.
 3.  Aldactone 25 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg three times per week.
 5.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Ativan.
 7.  Vicodin.
 8.  Nasal cannula oxygen 4 liters.
 9.  Diltiazem 300 mg by mouth once per day.
10.  Coumadin 1 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location (un) **].  He is
disabled.  He lives with his sister.  [**Name (NI) **] history of alcohol,
tobacco, or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 96.8
degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 70, his respiratory
rate was 12, his blood pressure was 92/42, and his oxygen
saturations were 90% on 4 liters.  In general, the patient
was in no apparent distress.  He was plethoric.  He was alert
and oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  The mucous membranes
were moist.  There was no thrush.  There were
telangiectasias.  Neck examination revealed he had a
Swan-Ganz catheter in place.  Respiratory examination
revealed the patient had decreased breath sounds at the right
base.  There were no rhonchi and no wheezes.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first
heart sounds and second heart sounds.  He did have a loud P2.
There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremity examination
revealed he had blisters on his shins.  He had dusky legs.
Mild sclerodactyly.  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed his white blood cell count was 15.1, his
hematocrit was 36.8, and his platelets were 273.  His
Chemistry-7 was significant for a sodium of 129 and a
creatinine of 2.1 (up from his baseline of 1.7).  His
arterial blood gas was 7.44/46/123.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His
hospital course by issue/system was as follows.

1.  PULMONARY ARTERY HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient with
pulmonary artery hypertension causing increasing shortness of
breath.

The patient was admitted for Flolan titration and sildenafil
therapy.  The patient's Flolan initially was left at 21
ng/kg/min and sildenafil was added at 25 mg three times per
day.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was used to monitor his
pulmonary artery pressures.  His pulmonary artery pressures
initially decreased by about 10% with the doses of
sildenafil; however, over the following days there was not
significant improvement in his pulmonary artery pressures
with this dose.

On [**2-6**], his Flolan dose was titrated up to 29
ng/kg/min; however, due to a headache, nausea, and vomiting
his dose had to be titrated down to 25 ng/kg/min.  On [**2-7**], it was titrated down to 23 ng/kg/min as it appeared that
he was having side effects, but no change in his pulmonary
artery pressures.

With regard to the sildenafil, he began experiencing
headaches.  Therefore, the decision was made to continue the
sildenafil q.8h. as needed; however, holding for headaches
and systolic blood pressures of less than 90.

If the patient persistently has shortness of breath, they may
do a thoracentesis and remove some of the fluid from the
right lung.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES/CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The
patient with an ejection fraction of 55%.  On admission, his
diuretics were held until his systolic blood pressure
improved.  The patient was placed on a low-sodium diet with a
fluid restriction.

On [**2-6**], he restarted his Bumex and Aldactone at his
home doses.  He appeared to be volume overloaded on the
evening of [**2-6**], so he was given some as-needed Lasix.
He was to restart his Zaroxolyn on Monday, and it will be at
a decreased dose.  It will be Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg every Monday
and Thursday only.  They will continue to measure
ins-and-outs and daily weights on the floor.

3.  RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  It appeared that the renal failure
had been in the setting of over diuresis as an outpatient.
It improved over the course of his hospital stay.  This will
continue to be followed.

4.  HYPONATREMIA ISSUES:  Again, the hyponatremia was likely
secondary to outpatient diuresis.  This improved over the
course of his hospital stay.  On discharge from the Intensive
Care Unit, his sodium was 132.

5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was
kept on a low-sodium/cardiac diet as noted above.

6.  ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was
pulled prior to leaving the Intensive Care Unit.

NOTE:  The rest of this dictation will be done upon discharge
from the hospital.

Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 49-year-old male with
past medical history of scleroderma (limited systemic sclerosis -
CREST syndrome) and NYHA Class IIIB-IV pulmonary hypertension, on
Flolan since [**2139-5-21**], CHF thought to be secondary to
diastolic dysfunction versus related to pulmonary hypertension,
who presented on [**2140-2-4**] status post right heart catheterization
after reporting a several week history of increasing shortness of
breath and dyspnea with exertion.

Patient had been stable on outpatient regimen of Flolan 75 cc per
24 hours, Bumex, aldactone, Zaroxolyn, and IV Lasix boluses since
last discharged in [**2139-11-21**].  However, for the past two
weeks, he has noted increasing dyspnea.  He had attempted to self
titrate his Flolan at home without relief. In response to his
symptoms, he underwent echocardiogram as an outpatient.
Echocardiogram on [**2140-2-2**] demonstrated mildly dilated left
atrium, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  The
right ventricle was moderately dilated with moderate global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  There is abnormal septal
motion in position consistent with right ventricular pressure,
volume overload, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation was noted.  There was
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There was
also moderate sized pericardial effusion, which was
circumferential, but with no signs of tamponade other than
brief right atrial collapse.

He was referred into the hospital by his primary pulmonologist
for right heart catheterization, and titration of his Flolan.
Right heart catheterization showed a mean pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 8 (earlier measurements raised possibility of
PCW = 27, but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] reviewed tracings and felt PCW = 8 more
accurate), mean right atrial pressure of 5, pulmonary artery
pressure of 69/12, right ventricle pressure of 68/4.
Demonstrated normal right and left sided filling pressures.
Cardiac output was relatively preserved at 5.52 liters per
minute.  Pulmonary vascular resistance was increased at 421.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was increased compared
with prior catheterizations when he had been on higher Flolan
doses.

Status post right heart catheterization, he was transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring as
well as titration of his Flolan.  While in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the Swan-Ganz catheter remained in place for
continuous monitoring.  He had a trial of sildenafil 25 mg
p.o. t.i.d. which demonstrated a drop in his pulmonary artery
pressure of approximately 10%, demonstrated increased cardiac
output, and a slight drop in his systolic blood pressure.
However, he had difficulty tolerating the sildenafil
secondary to severe headache.  Also while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, his Flolan was titrated up to a dose of
23 ng/kg/minute.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Scleroderma with CREST syndrome diagnosed approximately 20
years ago due to sclerodactyly.  Associated pulmonary
hypertension, on Flolan since [**2139-5-21**].  Pulmonary
function tests in [**2140-1-29**] showed worsening
restrictive function with FEV1 of 1.68 liters, FVC of 42%

calcium 9.1, phosphorus 4.4, magnesium 1.7.

Chest x-ray showed paracentral increase in densities, but
bilateral effusions consistent with pulmonary edema.

Chest CT from [**2140-2-2**] demonstrated diffuse central lobular
ground-glass opacities with smoothly thickened septal lines.
There was band-like areas of probable atelectasis at the
bases bilaterally.  There were moderate sized right pleural
effusions, which had increased in size compared with previous
studies.  There was prominence of the pulmonary artery.
There were minimal reticular opacities at the extreme left
base.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Dyspnea:  Patient's dyspnea was felt to be secondary to
worsening pulmonary hypertension.  While he was in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit, he had his Flolan dose titrated
up to 23 ng/kg/minute.  He also underwent a trial of
sildenafil for nitric oxide mediated dilatory effects,
however, this resulted in severe headache and patient was
unable to tolerate sildenafil.

After he failed his trial of sildenafil, we attempted to
titrate up his Flolan dose while on the floor.  However, he
did not tolerate the increased Flolan dose secondary to
dizziness, headache, and nausea.  He also underwent
esophageal balloon studies under the hypothesis that perhaps
some component of his dyspnea was due to chest wall
restriction secondary to scleroderma.  However, his
esophageal balloon studies showed relatively normal elastic
recoil of the chest wall and slightly increased recoil of
the lung consistent with interstitial edema/effusion or perhaps
early inflammatory/fibrotic changes from scleroderma.

It was postulated as well that perhaps some component of the
patient's dyspnea was secondary to his history of right
ventricular CHF.  Therefore, he was diuresed aggressively
while on the floor with Lasix intravenous, Bumex, metolazone,
spironolactone.  He continued to be followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
of the Advanced Heart Failure Clinic, and she and her staff
made recommendations as to changes to the medications
diuretic regimen in order to increase his subjective sense of
breathing improvement.

It was noted also that the patient had not been using the
recommended ice packs while using his Flolan at home.  These
ice packs help increase the efficacy and half-life of Flolan.
He was educated aggressively on the need to use the ice packs
with his Flolan in order to enhance his breathing.  Patient
had been tried on Bosentan in the past.  Per the patient, he
felt no subjective improvement with Bosentan alone.  It is
postulated that perhaps, Flolan and Bosentan together would
provide subjective improvement in his dyspnea.  He will
likely try this regimen as an outpatient.

Additionally, it was noted that the patient's diltiazem had
been discontinued while he was in the Medical Care Intensive
Care Unit.  It was discontinued in hopes that perhaps ACE
inhibitor would be more appropriate in providing afterload
reduction in light of his history of congestive heart
failure.  However, after discussion with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], diltiazem was reinitiated and ACE inhibitor was
held.  He will likely restart an ACE inhibitor as an
outpatient.

Finally, the patient underwent a repeat chest CT scan in
order ascertain whether the ground-glass opacities
demonstrated on his [**2140-2-2**] CT scan were indicated of
congestive heart failure or whether there was a secondary
process, possibly alveolitis, going on as well.  Initial read
of the chest CT demonstrated persistent ground-glass
opacities. Further followup will be required to determine if
this due to residual interstitial edema or early alveolitis.

2. Right ventricular congestive heart failure:  Patient had a
recent echocardiogram, which demonstrated preserved ejection
fraction.  It is unclear whether the mechanism of his CHF was
due to diastolic dysfunction alone or perhaps mediated by
severe pulmonary hypertension.  Initially, he was continued
on his outpatient regimen of Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg 3x a week,
Bumex, aldactone with Lasix added on an as needed basis for
continued diuresis.

He was followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from the Advanced Heart
Failure Clinic, who made recommendations as to the changes in
his regimen.  He was noted to have a right sided pleural
effusion on his CT scan.  He therefore was evaluated by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of the Interventional Pulmonary service,
who did a bedside ultrasound of the patient's effusion, and
found it to be a small subpulmonic effusion not amenable to
therapeutic thoracentesis.

In addition, to his aggressive diuretic regimen, he was
maintained on a low sodium diet with daily weights and I's
and O's recorded.  He diuresed well during this admission
with a several kg weight loss.  This corresponded with a
subjective improvement in his breathing.  The patient was
educated on the importance of the low sodium diet and the
importance of maintaining it while as an outpatient.
Additionally, a family member brought in his home scale for
calibration compared to the hospital scale.  Of note, the
patient's home scale was 3 pounds lighter than the hospital
scale.  His discharge instructions were to modify to account
for this difference.  As an outpatient, he will be maintained
on Bumex 4 mg p.o. b.i.d., spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d. as
well as metolazone sliding scale based on his weights.  He
was instructed to weigh himself daily and follow the sliding
scale accordingly.

3. Acute renal failure:  Upon admission, the patient had a
slight bump in his creatinine most likely secondary to
prerenal versus diuretic-induced causes.  He had no evidence
of urinary sediment to suggest sclerodermal renal crisis.
His creatinine improved with fluid hydration while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  It remained relatively stable during
continued diuresis on the floor.

4. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient was
maintained on a low sodium diet.  His electrolytes were
followed serially and repleted as needed.  His potassium was
monitored closely in light of his history of hypokalemia, it
was repleted aggressively.

5. Code status:  The patient is full code.

6. Access:  The patient has a right internal jugular
Permacath.

7. Disposition:  Patient was discharged to home once his
dyspnea had improved.  Of note, his weight on day of
discharge on hospital scale was 69.5 kg, which is within his
baseline range.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Afebrile.  Hemodynamically
stable.  Dyspnea stable.  Tolerating oral intake without
nausea or vomiting.  Ambulating independently.  Weight at
69.5 kg.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient was discharged to home with
services.

is based on the hospital scale.  Patient brought in his home
scale, and the home and hospital scales were calibrated
appropriately.  He is to dose metolazone as follows based on
his weight on his home scale:  If his weight is less than 150
pounds, he should not take any metolazone.  If his weight is
between 150-153 pounds, he should take metolazone 2.5 mg p.o.
q.d.  If his weight is greater than 153 pounds, he is to call
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and notify him of his increased
weight and likely increased fluid retention.

FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient has a father and brother with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  She has a sister with
breast cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   History of tobacco use, rare alcohol use.
She lives with her cousin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature of 102.0
F.; blood pressure ranging from 79 to 96 over 26 to 45; heart
rate of 89; oxygen saturation 96% on four liters by nasal
cannula.  In general, the patient is an elderly female
sitting in bed in no apparent respiratory distress.  HEENT:
Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm.  Lung examination with slight
crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.  Abdominal
examination is obese, soft, nontender, with some distention.
Extremities with one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally.
Positive for asterixis.  Alert and oriented times three and
able to follow commands.

LABORATORY:  On admission are notable for a white blood cell
count of 12.6 with 78% neutrophils.  Her hematocrit is 30.4
down from 36.1.  Her creatinine is 2.3 up from 0.9.
Urinalysis was negative.

Liver function tests within normal limits.

EKG shows possible atrial arrhythmia with a rate at 70 to 80
beats per minute.  There is left axis deviation and a right
bundle branch block.  There are diffuse T wave inversions in
the anteroseptal leads which is new.

Chest x-ray shows peri-hilar haziness but no definite
infiltrate or pulmonary vascular congestion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient was hypotensive with a
systolic blood pressure in the 60s on admission that was not
fluid responsive.  She was enrolled in a MUST protocol for
presumed sepsis given the temperature spike to 102.0 F.;
however, in the Medical Intensive Care Unit it was felt that
the etiology of her hypertension was most likely
multifactorial.  They felt that she probably had an early
pneumonia causing poor p.o. intake in the setting of
underlying dysphagia, causing prerenal acute renal failure
which, in turn, decreased clearance of her MS-Contin.  They
also felt that her acute renal failure was then exacerbated
by Lasix causing hypovolemia and hypotension in a patient who
is preload dependent secondary to her right ventricular
dysfunction and increased pulmonary artery pressures.

The patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and after
three liters of normal saline her central venous pressure was
approximately 17 to 20 and further intravenous fluid boluses
were stopped.  Her SVO2 was greater than 70, however, the
patient remained hypotensive and so she was started on low
dose of Levophed.  The patient was taken off sepsis protocol
since sepsis at that time was not suspected.

The patient was started on Levofloxacin for a presumed
community acquired pneumonia.  Urinalysis was negative.
Blood cultures were obtained but they were no growth to date.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her O2 remained stable
and the patient did not require any intubation.

Eventually, the patient was able to be taken off Levophed the
following day and her blood pressure remained stable
throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.  Sputum
cultures were obtained which grew Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Chest x-ray was now showing a left
lower lobe opacity with a persistent left pleural effusion.
Given these findings, the patient was started on Vancomycin,
initially at one gram intravenously q. day based on age.  A
trough of Vancomycin level was drawn prior to the third dose
and was found to be low at 5.9.  Following curbside with
Infectious Disease, her Vancomycin dose was increased to 1.5
mg q. 24 hours.

The patient, according to Infectious Disease, should be
continued on the Vancomycin dose for at least two weeks.
Since her blood cultures showed no growth, there was no need
to prolong the course of Vancomycin for greater than two
weeks.

An echocardiogram was obtained to determine her ventricular
function as well as to look for endocarditis.  It showed a
left atrium that was moderately dilated, a right atrium that
was moderately dilated, a left ventricular cavity size that
was borderline dilated, left ventricular ejection fraction of
greater than 55%, right ventricular cavity was mildly
dilated, right ventricular systolic function was borderline
normal.  She had one to two plus mitral regurgitation and
three plus tricuspid regurgitation.  There was moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and no pericardial
effusion.  There was no evidence for endocarditis seen on
transthoracic echocardiogram.

The patient was also continued on Levofloxacin which was
started empirically in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
fevers, for possible community acquired pneumonia and will be
treated with a total of a two week course.

Upon transfer to the Floor, the patient developed diarrhea.
Three separate samples on three separate days were sent for
Clostridium difficile which all returned as negative.  The
diarrhea improved throughout the course of the
hospitalization.  It is felt that her initial fever was
likely from this pneumonia and there was no other infectious
etiology found.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of diastolic
congestive heart failure.  An echocardiogram was obtained to
determine her systolic function.  Left ventricular ejection
fraction was greater than 55% although she had a borderline
normal right ventricular systolic function with one to two
plus mitral regurgitation, three plus tricuspid regurgitation
and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  The
patient ruled out for myocardial infarction on admission with
three sets of negative enzymes.

Following transfer to the Floor after the patient had been
hemodynamically stable for greater than 24 hours, the patient
was restarted back on her home doses of Diovan for blood
pressure control.  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.  The
patient, however, was not started on Lasix due to persistent
diarrhea.  The patient was asked to weigh herself at home.
She was told not to take Lasix for now but should she gain
more than two pounds, she should call her primary care
physician for recommendations on whether to restart Lasix.
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up in three days
following discharge to see her primary care physician.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient has a history of emphysema and is
on home O2.  She also has obstructive sleep apnea and uses
BiPAP at home.  The patient's O2 saturation remained stable
throughout the remainder of the hospitalization and she did
not require intubation.  She was also continued on her home
inhalers and given nebulizers as needed.

4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient was admitted with a
creatinine of 2.3.  Following aggressive fluid resuscitation,
her creatinine returned to baseline and it was felt that her
acute renal failure was likely prerenal in etiology.

5.  DISPOSITION:  The patient was seen by Physical Therapy
and they recommended home with home Physical Therapy.  The
Medicine Team recommended pulmonary rehabilitation to the
patient, however, the patient declined pulmonary
rehabilitation stating that she had been discharged
previously to pulmonary rehabilitation and that they had not
been able to do anything for her.  The patient wished to go
home with home services.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Hemodynamically stable, ambulating,
O2 saturations stable on two liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula during the day and BiPAP overnight, pain free.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient is discharged to home with
home services including home oxygen and home Physical
Therapy.

Addendum:
On POD #7 the patient was evaluated for discharge but was kept
in-house for persistant leaking from his chest tube sight.  His
Decadron taper was continud and serial chest x-rays did not show
pneumothorax.  On POD #8, a sputumn culture was positive for
resistant pseudomonas and klebsiella and he was started on
Meropenem and Cipro.  A Picc line was placed for long-term
antibiotics.
.
On POD#12 it was noted by Physical Therapy that Mr [**Known lastname **] was
slurring his words.  On evaluation it was noted that his left
side was weaker and a stroke consult was called.  An emergent
MRI/MRA Brain was negative for stroke.  He was transferred to
the CSRU.  Neurology followed closely and it was determined that
his symtoms were likely toxic/metabolic as he his CO2 was 57.
His work-up included a negative EEG for concern of seizures.
His symtoms resolved over the course of one day, but he remained
in the CSRU for close monitoring.
.
On POD #14, Mr [**Known lastname **] became acutely short of breath and his
sternal wound was noted to be oozing and unstable on
examination.  Chest X-ray and Chest CT were consistent with
sternal dehiscence and he was taken to the OR with Plastic
Surgery for bilateral pectoral advancement flaps.  Please see OP
report for details.  He tolerated the procedure well and
recovered in the CSRU, being extubated on POD #1 without
difficulty.  He was placed on stress dose steroids and started
on Vancomycin along with Cipro and Meropenem.  He received 2
days of TPN for nutritional support at family request secondary
to poor po intake.  Nutrition was following.  He recovered very
well and was to be discharged on POD #20/5.  Meropenem and Cipro
were stopped, and Vancomycin is continued while there is
erythema and draiange from midsternal incision or until a few
days after the JP drains are removed . On POD 21/6 he was found
to be dyspneic, for which he was placed on bipap. He was seen in
contultation by pulmonology dopplers of lower extremeties to
evaluate for PE.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was again ready for discharge to rehab, but became
febrile, with an elevated WBC.  He was reintubated on [**10-30**] for
respiratory distress.  A CT scan revealed air, with possible
flap dehiscence.  He went to the OR on [**10-31**] for mediastinal
re-exploration and VAC placement.  Antibiotics were resumed
(Vancomycin, Meropenem, Cipro, and Fluconazole).
On [**11-1**], he underwent a bronchoscopy, sputum revealed resistant
pseudomonas (for which he is on Cipro).  Due to the need for
continued vent. support, he underwent tracheostomy on [**2174-11-4**].
Renal medicine was consulted on [**2174-11-2**] due to rising creatinine
(peaked at 3.0).  They felt this was ATN due to clinical
situation, and his function has subsequently improved.
He was nutritionally supported with TPN as well as tube
feedings.  He is now tolerating his tube feedings at goal rate,
and the TPN may be discontinued.  A double lumen PICC line was
placed on [**2174-11-12**], and his Left IJ line was removed.  His VAC
dressing was changed on [**2174-11-12**], and is due to be changed every
3 days.
He ahs remained hemodynamically stable, tolerating longer
periods of PSV weaning daily, and is ready to be transferred to
a rehab to progress with physical therapy and ventilator
weaning.
